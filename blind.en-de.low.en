yes , good day , my day , ladies are my ladies ladies and gentlemen , ladies and gentlemen .
so , so , very good for you to talk about the time in the time of the time , and you 're going to talk about the time in the time .
and i 've got to imagine myself now .
my name is christian <unknown> , and i 'm a feeling of funny thinking , <unknown> <unknown> at the city .
this is called <unknown> <unknown> for eight years .
and my <unknown> is , first of all , the organization , two of the foundation , the third organization , the third thing to do is the public news .
so i 'm responsible for the <unknown> of this city , and so that 's a responsible for this town .
and so , you do n't really be proud of being done .
i know .
and over the time , and that 's something that is something like my son , particularly i am also working on .
this is what i call the <unknown> of the <unknown> <unknown> .
<unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
and i think of thinking about it , of course , is , of course , is , a theme important , i 'm going to be able to talk to you today .
so with the theme of the <unknown> , because of the theme of the <unknown> , because this is also the way that it is also to be able to use it .
we hope , we hope , we 're hoping to the best and more , we 're going to be in the worst , and i 've talked to the ted talks to the point of once again .
you know it .
he was once in general <unknown> , a <unknown> <unknown> .
and then , i 'm not going to tell you a little bit wrong to say , `` i 'm not going to be honest serious with the <unknown> .
i 'm going to give you a sense .
so we 're talking about if we 're going to give the risk that we 're going to be at a disaster moment , we 're going to be short of a disaster , like <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> .
many people are on the other hand .
it 's going to make it , it 's <unknown> , it 's <unknown> .
and somewhere in the presence is a suitcase , i put a pair of hands , fire , <unknown> , something <unknown> , maybe <unknown> <unknown> , maybe <unknown> <unknown> .
no one seems to be .
the suitcase one belongs to no script .
and it 's a <unknown> , a whole thing of all .
leave the <unknown> <unknown> .
police come to <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> .
people call the <unknown> .
<unknown> <unknown> .
go out .
what 's happened ? what 's going to be ? yes , <unknown> <unknown> .
we do n't know , or we do n't know , or we ca n't say to say , `` we ca n't say to say , we 're not going to say it .
people are the same time the day they leave the building .
kids cry crying .
so even even , if you may have no even , because it 's going to be anything fast .
and some of them are a little bit of a <unknown> .
there 's <unknown> in the ground .
a panic move out to come up .
i hear today , i hear here .
i 'll just leave the rest of my own imagination , and i 'll take your own imagination .
but it 's not a gift that i 've been doing , `` <unknown> '' -- <unknown> -- <unknown> ?
this is exactly what this is in a week where there 's a week in <unknown> , and i 've been doing in <unknown> .
there 's a certain basis of a suitcase .
and then , you know , the one of the time they showed it , only , in <unknown> , nine hundred dollars of the world were born in a <unknown> .
but the people were so much , and so , a friend gave me a little bit of me , and asked the friend to come from the building .
it was told about it .
and what came out of this very few days of all the time that you have to do is the group of who were my friend who wrote my friend who came to my friend , and i found that my friend had been found out .
god is not happy to be optimistic , otherwise , otherwise , the whole good news was n't <unknown> because they 'd have n't seen so bad <unknown> as it seems .
you can see , in a <unknown> , in a <unknown> disaster , a <unknown> disaster communications , a social media is a very good thing .
communication is so important because because people used to use it in this situation in <unknown> , to gather the <unknown> for the <unknown> to the <unknown> .
they want to know what they 're going to do .
in the way , the same time , in the good , old days was the only way to the only market , and just the only way to do , but the only thing we did .
we just have to say nothing about ourselves or we have done .
why ?
because the so-called <unknown> one is the <unknown> guy .
you have <unknown> to say , god , people who are <unknown> to panic , and we 're not saying , `` do n't stop the truth or we 're the <unknown> .
this is a social media lab , at a time from twitter , in a time of facebook , in a time of private and public health , and at a time , not only about it .
just and <unknown> of this because of course , the first one is , but the second thing is , we 're often most of the last <unknown> center that talks about what 's happened .
you may remember , if you remember the <unknown> in the hudson river , there 's a few years ago , there 's a year year ago .
the first quotation about this , came out to twitter .
somebody who was on a thumb , and just <unknown> and <unknown> immediately , <unknown> , and here 's a plane , and we 're going to save people on the right now .
this was no <unknown> .
you see , we 're seeing it just just like today , just as often , and the way of thinking of <unknown> and tell stories of the truth of the truth and say , <unknown> , to make a <unknown> and <unknown> .
because of course , we 're also the last thing that we think about the first thing , the truth of the truth , because we need to do it as a result of information that we 're just going to take to information information .
and so , public policy and public media or either private health can not be so much or whether they do n't even do it .
so , we 're going to eat , and that 's also something that was just once in the media , we think about how we interact with the future with <unknown> relationships .
and we 're going to do the same old <unknown> <unknown> out of the <unknown> .
however , just as a form of <unknown> .
that 's what we call about a hundred years of the <unknown> in the <unknown> , which is , some of you know , that if you look at the <unknown> ,
and it was in the way , it was in the way that it was working on it for the way .
you may know , you know , what three times is , what three times short , again , just a long time , even briefly , even long , and even short , and even short , and i 'm going to be short .
i do n't know it .
we 're going to do this with the challenges that we 're going to do , and the <unknown> , over facebook , over the radio , and the internet and the internet and all the way , and
and we know , we have to go very quickly and <unknown> , and we have to actually work very fast and <unknown> , because the <unknown> and the people will be <unknown> .
and eventually , we also have n't even know that we believe that we should say , `` we want to say .
so communication in the crisis or in the disaster stage , one of the problems are <unknown> by all media , which are available to us , and it 's also a question by random .
the ecm is our biggest problem , because the <unknown> and citizens say , `` well , '' `` the moment of the truth , '' is not exactly , or you say , `` the <unknown> '' are us better .
we 've also been so good experience with facebook and twitter , and even a long time , once recently recently recently .
but also , you may have some of you some of you some of you some of you have some of you in the media .
we 've had a major <unknown> <unknown> in food production , which we had to do .
and one of the so-called electric whales have a <unknown> chemical bomb .
this is <unknown> that are armed with a <unknown> , because the only thing to do with the first <unknown> , but it 's going to go to the ground of the other <unknown> , and it 's a little bit of a <unknown>
the problem is , only many of these bombs have never been working , and they 're going to be able to go to the <unknown> of the <unknown> in other people in the <unknown> .
and there we have been a guy 's husband , who was a certain way that he was like to be <unknown> in the establishment , and we were going to have seen it as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as it was a <unknown> about it , there 's a crime .
by the way , there 's several days of <unknown> , several older residents came out of all of the <unknown> , and so that 's where they were going to be <unknown> .
we will see what we 're going to find out all of this . we can find everything else .
this means , they had to be <unknown> , they could n't have no <unknown> , not <unknown> , but they will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
and so we 've just played a <unknown> park and we 're going to take some of the <unknown> , and it 's a very good way of the word of the word , a <unknown> <unknown> .
and the world 's medicine , the whole communication of facebook and twitter , let 's have the set of the <unknown> that the entire <unknown> was far more <unknown> over the <unknown> <unknown> over the <unknown>
and the media was thrilled to be the story . in the background . it 's been in the background .
we did n't have to go to the <unknown> , but they have the <unknown> , and they have <unknown> and <unknown> , all over the <unknown> , and over and over the time .
and all of this had a great effect for us to make a great effect for us , because the tumor treating energy is <unknown> , which is the <unknown> media that is about the social media .
just as you have to take a sign , you have to give you a sign if i want to stop .
i ca n't look at the watch here , and i can look at the watch here .
that 's the tumor so the top of this , because first of these social media have the advantage that they have found that , they have a skill that they can actually get to information from information .
not so much <unknown> , because the members of you have a fractal , or the <unknown> , as the <unknown> , as it is called `` a <unknown> , '' <unknown> , who are <unknown> ,
two , early designers , <unknown> simpson .
if something is not true , so if someone were the <unknown> , which i 've talked about , is that all the community community are essentially to be involved in the <unknown> .
and it 's a very high <unknown> <unknown> , so if something is wrong , it can also be very quickly , and it can be very quickly .
and we have a huge <unknown> structure of a <unknown> .
i said , `` oh , who was the thought of what was going to be , what a paper was like a bomb , like a victory of the park , the <unknown> was a <unknown> park , and the <unknown> is in the park .
so , we have all of the things that we 've been done in the last few years , and it 's much more <unknown> than the other way that we think of a sense of view , a <unknown> .
but also , the city is food , they can be used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unknown> from this one of the catastrophe of a disaster .
a bomb that has been going to be trapped in a park , it 's certainly not such such a way that is like this .
but it can also , and also after we , we 're going to be able to find out of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the world , and then we 're here with our <unknown> and try and put it into the <unknown> in the <unknown> , and we can actually put it in seven feet .
and if you think about it , you think about <unknown> , think about other cities , if you 've got to have a <unknown> , you can have a <unknown> , you can not just listen to it , you know , we 're going to be , like , we 're going to be
and so , to think about it , because it 's difficult to be in a world 's <unknown> speed , to help cancer , to make sure that people are trying to make sure that people are capable of making the things that they 're doing , in the difficult
and the social media helps us to be <unknown> because it 's all involved in the communication , and it 's not just a <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> , and we also have the <unknown> in the <unknown> , and also , in the
so , today 's not today is not just a task of the authorities , not just a task of fire , or the <unknown> , the <unknown> , the windows , the windows , but with the <unknown> , and communication in the
and what we did is , that 's what we showed up .
there 's over three and over facebook , a result of the help , if you have to be <unknown> , because suddenly , people could have a <unknown> , and they did n't know what the
that 's , it 's a lot of work for the public communication system , but the <unknown> <unknown> with the <unknown> and the <unknown> <unknown> , and it was clear that the social media were from a <unknown> , from a communication
and i hope i 've been showing you a little bit of this , that this is actually a lot of life of life , and it 's a little bit of a sense of the <unknown> , and that 's what i 'm going to do , to be able to do all the
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening evening .
i 'm a <unknown> different .
i 'm a writer and <unknown> , as you like , you 've heard about it .
and i 'm now now , i 'm just going to be a way of thinking about a personal <unknown> experience .
what it 's been saying is that i 'm going to make a lot of doing here , i think , is that , i think , you know , i think you 're going to do you exactly the same thing as well .
before i do that , i have to do the few things that i 've got to do is a couple of things .
the first is , i think we really need really really interested in all of the lives of life .
that we do n't have no longer to do not have no longer with no stories .
i also think there 's a lot more important , more complex , <unknown> , <unknown> stories , where we 're going to be produced by the art industry ,
and i also believe that the internet is the <unknown> , which is a lot of <unknown> , which is actually <unknown> very well , which is <unknown> good as well as well as it is <unknown> , really , really , no <unknown> right now .
and the last thing i 'm proposing is that i 'm convinced of this message of that these people were created , is that they were created for the way to be creative , to be creative .
and they 're happier , even though they 're going to be useful , and when they 're going to be creative .
the more people happy happy , the better ones are going to be the world .
it 's a sense of feeling that makes sense of weight .
so , the better world is now just a <unknown> now , which is just a <unknown> .
in the first one , i think , as a result , i think , `` well , i said , `` well , '' in fact , i think , a storyteller 's imagination .
and the story that i want to tell you , is going to be in the <unknown> , in the <unknown> , in some balmy <unknown> , is going to be <unknown> <unknown> .
this is <unknown> .
and it <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
now , you get the <unknown> and the singing at all , you know , in the moment , where the <unknown> would be lost , it 's something that happens to be happened , you can find a
it 's something in your head , in your body , with your body .
and she does n't really have words to do .
you do n't know what 's happened .
but i 've been giving you a good news for this .
i call the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
you see here in the side of the <unknown> and a <unknown> in the <unknown> , and in the same time in <unknown> , and everything is pretty black .
i 've been doing the feeling of what i feel like a very <unknown> is , very , i 'm kind of a pretty <unknown> contraption .
<unknown> .
and on the other hand , we have the two , and the other thing that we have to do is both of two , we have the two <unknown> of the land , and it 's very different from the very much way to make a lot of color .
and i think that 's the reason i thought for me , i think , <unknown> , i write better and write about it for me as i would be , and i think , and i 'm going to share a <unknown> .
so , the first thing that you 're seeing now with the new perception is , the <unknown> man with <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> who she was looking at very seriously , and says , `` excuse me , ''
this is <unknown> .
and <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> on the idea that she heard about a very specific way of people .
it was born born as a <unknown> <unknown> .
somi are people who have a given to the end of their <unknown> to age 12 to their own lives .
who is you who asked them who asked you who asked them to get tenure ?
very beautiful .
imagine if you do n't think of the <unknown> in this <unknown> , it 's not <unknown> if you can meet , but you 're not a little bit of <unknown> , from the pocket .
so , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , all sorts of things , and all possible things .
what 's really important , is important , the player has no idea on the <unknown> , and the <unknown> is not a glimpse of the <unknown> .
we do n't know if we do n't know if we die !
i wish you 'd like to do that , but i do n't like to be a long life of life , but we just do n't just like it .
it can also be a morning , and it can be anywhere else 's coming in , and it can be over the morning .
and so , it 's , in my hair , it 's also like my hair also so as well as well as well as well .
they do n't know , they do n't know how much they 're doing , because they 're doing something like that , but actually , play with play because of a way , they can actually play games .
that means that every year , again , every lost minute could be been the last minute .
a player who 's a very difficult who has its own life , and <unknown> <unknown> at the moment of the <unknown> of the <unknown> , like a <unknown> , which is a <unknown> that 's going to be <unknown> .
now you can ask yourself questions : if the thing that is dangerous , why is that dangerous , why do you want to do it ?
the answer is clear that clear , that 's the way , and that 's the way , and that 's the way , and that 's the way , and that 's the way , and that 's the way , and that 's the way , you know , that 's the way that we have , the answer is , '' ] .
without play , without hearing up there , a little bit of a <unknown> , all <unknown> and all around and a question for a player is to be a real place , he 's actually alive .
the whole thing was born with games .
so that 's how we do .
this story of <unknown> and how you 're now going to the world of the player , to get your first challenges and you 're all going to happen in <unknown> in the middle of the service , and that 's the story that i want to tell you .
in a form of a <unknown> .
the first one of them has been taking the consequences , including , i 'm going to be a <unknown> , and i 've seen a little bit more <unknown> , and i 've seen just too late .
so , 12 consequences in the first time with the first is with a long period of about five minutes seven minutes .
this kind of <unknown> , a consequence of the other , and <unknown> of the story , telling you , you know , you know , you know .
the television does n't work in the <unknown> . because of course , this particular thing has nothing different .
this is not new .
and if it was everything , then , i was going to be , as well as i 'm going to come up with this , i think , what you 're looking at is actually going to be .
and even even though , it 's also not happening here , and then , in this way , not even do it at all .
but now , it 's all right next .
let 's go back to the long time , <unknown> , let 's go back to the <unknown> .
what is the most famous sentence from the film or out of the film ?
it can only give you a pair of , right now , right ?
thank you .
as we were going to have that if we had to have this , and we 'd have to have that much .
and that 's exactly what the wrong thing is not to be happy .
there 's a lot of many ways to be there very much .
there are so many different games , and there 's so many different games .
think about it , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> and so on .
and so , so that 's so the <unknown> thing that 's <unknown> is also the number of players .
and so , of course , there 's a lot of stories that you want to tell us all about the stories .
now the next question : if anybody would ask you , who would you tell you all of all ?
i 've already had a lot of people who told me that i 'm sorry about me .
i feel like a smart deal with a smart and strong creative and powerful creative .
but i know that a lot of brains do more more than just as one , but if it 's a moment , if there 's my time .
and so what it was about , and what was the idea of being was to put the <unknown> of the <unknown> , the <unknown> <unknown> , the <unknown> process of <unknown> , '' in the creative process of <unknown> , and so that 's where the <unknown> effect is <unknown> .
what if we do n't want to do n't just simply to do , or allow them to use it , or we can allow us to <unknown> , but even even <unknown> ?
so if you say , we 're going to make you very much , it 's a very quick deal with a <unknown> that we use to repair this device using the <unknown> with the <unknown> .
imagine , for example , the number three is a <unknown> , and a <unknown> that you 've ever been great class , because it 's recalling you 're conscious for you , and then she 's discovering you for your grandfather .
and then they 're also a huge fan of <unknown> , they 're a very fan of <unknown> <unknown> .
now , you can just do , for example , with technology , it 's not so much more hard to do , but that 's not really hard to make a <unknown> , and a <unknown> <unknown> .
and this is what i 'm going to do it is to do this on the <unknown> where it 's right now , and that 's the really cool cool <unknown> that 's really being really <unknown> to be in the audience .
that means , it 's not going to be somewhere , but it 's going to be there , right where there 's going to be able to land it out .
and the really beautiful thing is that we 're also about that we are on the internet .
you can really do anything that all of the things are all about the internet .
so , all the medium is all of the medium , it 's kind of <unknown> .
that means what you 're reading is , as you can write about , as you can write , you 're read , you , whatever you want to do .
and if we also have this kind of look at this structure , we can see this structure structure .
this is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a <unknown> web , and what ?
so this is what i 've been doing is that <unknown> <unknown> , which is going to be built together .
and i 'm really <unknown> of this argument that the internet was born , to tell the story of stories .
unfortunately , we do n't even have so much , but no longer do n't even have any of the same , no longer , nor any other .
so , now , i 'm just going to go back to the step , and i even go back and step , and i 'll get a look at the audience , and i will take the audience to the players , and then they will be able to get the players to answer .
and in a <unknown> , which is in a <unknown> .
because you can do it in the meantime , you can also use the characters of the series of food , but in the real environment that are the very <unknown> , which are these <unknown> <unknown> on their cell phone .
<unknown> of them who do n't think you all very good , they 're very good , it 's something like mobile phone and <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
these wonderful areas that are going to develop very very much like this .
and i do n't even can think , because i 'd need to thank you 10 minutes ago .
we 've been leaning together .
and every time , it 's time to be about three parts of three parts .
the first part is the <unknown> , the second part is the <unknown> , and then we have the <unknown> , and we 're going to take the <unknown> .
and so , i could have this <unknown> , i was able to take the mushrooms who we can say , i have to be just going to be the short -- the <unknown> innovation of innovation ,
the thing that i 've had to do was the first one of the best i have been doing my first price of the best <unknown> .
and i have to say , this <unknown> consisted of <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> and <unknown> .
so anybody else was supposed to be a lot of the people , should n't mean , i 'm told you .
and if i can convince my hand , here , the internet is actually using the structures , <unknown> , <unknown> , but i think , can be able to convince my own .
so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so
everyone 's always one , why is this one of the mind , so what 's the result of this ?
because of all , in the <unknown> , in the name of all , the food will be saved by the <unknown> , and it 's going to be <unknown> by the <unknown> .
we 've been , of course , the <unknown> , which is , i 'm not , you 're on , you 're on , you 're on , you 're on , you 're on , you 're on , you 're on , you 're on , you 're on , you 're on , you 're on , you 're on , you 're on all of every other .
of course , the course of course , they die , die , which die .
in the series of the past , there are very many of the very much die .
everybody is just to say , everybody has to die .
and , of course , everybody is at least every time of every player can be happy if he wants to do this .
that 's pretty important . i 'm really interested in this .
i come here to the <unknown> , and there 's nothing bad , my opinion , when it 's going to be a <unknown> , you know , if it 's a <unknown> .
i do n't know if they know what they know .
if you 're in the theater , and then the abalone thing that is the painting , like the abalone hulk , and all of the god , oh , oh god , please , i do n't want me to do me .
and it 's not one of the things .
so it 's volunteers with a lot of interaction .
no one has to be .
it can only be possible to be close to the audience , and also , you can just be close to the audience .
the reason why i 'm a writer of ted is that the thing is going to be the fact that the entire project is going to be in the first , and first , is that i 'm going to be first , first , i think , first ,
and also , you have a couple of reasons .
i was with this project <unknown> , and i was always asked to myself , i think , `` all of the things are english , '' second , <unknown> , blah blah , blah blah , blah blah , blah blah , blah blah , blah .
i 'm only saying , `` i have the word , i 'm going to say , the german <unknown> is the third largest world 's population , the largest <unknown> of the world .
the <unknown> is the english , the dutch guy , and the spanish and the french , and then the german one is the germans .
so now , it 's not like , as we 're going to move us in some little bit of <unknown> , we would move to a little bit of <unknown> events .
and i really think that 's because i think , if you 're in fact , there 's other people like me that people are being grateful for something that was not being used by any <unknown> <unknown> , where the <unknown> was <unknown> , and every <unknown> <unknown> had been <unknown> .
if it 's all the way that i 'm going to do it like i 'd like to do it , then the first thing is going to go back to the first <unknown> <unknown> online , and then we 're going to go to the first <unknown> online dating online dating night .
and if you 're wondering , why i 'm here today , in a <unknown> , where there 's a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
i also also had a couple of thoughts that i did . i did some of a thought of thought .
i love <unknown> <unknown> .
not just <unknown> .
i 'm also dependent on almost <unknown> and <unknown> , and <unknown> , and <unknown> , <unknown> .
a few <unknown> <unknown> was also a <unknown> <unknown> , and also <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> .
and i 'm only saying that one thing is , because of all the things that it 's incredibly important is , and it 's incredibly important and incredible , <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> .
but it does n't mean anything because if you do n't do it , if you do n't work on it , you 're not able to manipulate it , it 's not possible .
and my project is just a very simple thing . i just just got to be able to put all i 've been doing , what i 've learned to do .
and it 's made it in a way .
and yet , it 's good at all right now .
i can just say , `` well , i can just say , i think , `` well , i can say , i can say , `` i can just say .
so , if you think , well , if you 're thinking about it , i 'm going to have my part of this , i had a device to give a sense of a character , or i 've got to <unknown> the cartoon of the song , or whatever it is now now .
you 've got to look at the internet . you 've got to look at the internet .

great , as a matter of how to give you the speakers .
yes , i think , i know , i 'm also going to do that , i think , `` i 'm afraid . '' i 'm afraid to do .
thank you , if you can taste memories , you can reactivate memories ?
ask yourself to ask the question .
can you prioritize memories , can you prioritize memories ?
can you remember what happens in your life ?
do you have <unknown> <unknown> ?
who do n't someone remember who ? remember , what could possibly remember ?
it 's no hands on your hands .
so , can you prioritize activities ?
apparently , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well
thank you very much .
no , no way that we do n't want to do n't do this . but we do n't want to do it , we do n't want to do today .
and the reason that talk about the moment , it would be pretty short about the talk of a long time .
well , again , there 's a good evening , and my dad 's samuel <unknown> samuel <unknown> howard .
the talk today , i 've been showing me , because he gave me two of my passions or my two big blog , <unknown> , and i 'm going to share two of these <unknown>
i 've been able to put in a <unknown> where i 've been able to go to the <unknown> and i 've been able to do with my feet and <unknown> me , which are so much of the size of the world , and so far through the world .
and even , even a certain time , i 'm also working on a cocktail and <unknown> in the private and <unknown> in the private and the deep field , and the deep field on the ground .
so on the side , i have a lot of work with the computer , and i 'm going to be now contributing in the human <unknown> of the <unknown> , so how does it work to the human ?
how can we change this ?
and to get out to the top user dating coming out of a mammogram .
i was recently in a very interesting story about artificial intelligence , artificial intelligence , <unknown> <unknown> .
so the question was , when we can go , when we can build a computer that works as a way of how much human brain ?
so , and i think we 're going to be quite close to this .
so i think you 're going to say , two hundred years ago , it 's not a lot of time , no longer it does n't even change more than that .
but let me just tell you why we might be familiar with why the only need to be done .
so the comparison between the computer on the computer , on the side of the side of the side of our own , and our brains on the other side of the other side .
if we take the computer , there 's all the smartphone , the <unknown> , you 're <unknown> , and you can also get these cameras and all of these things , and all of these smart spaces on the little <unknown>
he 's called a <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
these parts are <unknown> <unknown> from <unknown> events .
the word has been heard of anybody who 's probably heard , and in the way , the <unknown> is going to be able to recognize the way that we 're looking at it as a triangle .
the <unknown> little device , which has three <unknown> , and it 's got three <unknown> and <unknown> light , and it 's not moving through the oil , not by <unknown> .
in our computer in our computer , we have a <unknown> , and i have a <unknown> of <unknown> , about five hundred million years of this little parts of this little parts of this little parts of this little bit of the small parts of this little .
and the nest maintenance line of caution are fixed <unknown> .
we 're doing , we can make things we have to do with , we 've had a <unknown> to the famous quote , `` well , <unknown> can work very much , but it 's just going to just
more of it can not be .
and actually , it 's actually a quotation from a <unknown> .
let 's take it to the future , with our brain , we want to focus on our brain .
our brains have a tiny unit of the neuron , the neuron , and the thing , and we 've been there , because i have a <unknown> billion billion , so many billion neurons are in our carbon mass among the
the beautiful thing is , our brains , they have only only three connections , but they have n't only to take us to the <unknown> to a <unknown> area .
and that makes a <unknown> <unknown> , just because it 's just because it 's beautiful , is 10 trillion .
this is 10 of the 400 zeroes after the two minutes , and i 'm a few minutes of 14 minutes .
so , now , now , now , you see the complexity of the brain is about a lot more than the thing that we 've seen right now , and what we 've seen in the first time is now at the computer .
so let 's take the <unknown> , and maybe that 's the first time that the first favela that have had the best buying web , not the <unknown> , and the <unknown> of the <unknown> <unknown> was the <unknown> <unknown> of the
our <unknown> <unknown> sometimes sometimes have been <unknown> , but the box here is about the two of the sand , about it , about the 20th century .
and the thing that is , and that 's the equivalent of two great bananas , so , if you need n't need and do n't you , and you have a <unknown> with a game of a straight place .
if we 're so good good at all right here , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> with the <unknown> , why do n't we say why do we then do things ?
perhaps one of the things that you have , or some of these <unknown> in the internet , the human use of 10 percent of your brain , they 're now going to be able to get this <unknown> to the <unknown> brain to the <unknown> brain .
and then , if you 're <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> the <unknown> a little bit more fun .
ten percent may be , but our brains are actually in the course of our evolution to this distribution that has been a little bit less , very different , and in the middle , the other is <unknown> ,
that 's not going to happen because we ca n't use that , because we ca n't use this .
why does it seems that we 're going to take the biggest part of this <unknown> ?
maybe you might know you know that the <unknown> of the <unknown> ?
i 'm asking the way to the game with the inside of the iceberg , if you see the inside of the inside , you 're going to be inside the inside , in the ocean , the <unknown> , like the top , the ocean , the ocean , the ocean , it 's a <unknown> .
and this 10 percent , that 's what we call what the <unknown> <unknown> , our <unknown> mind is , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , but <unknown> <unknown> is a <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> ,
we 're <unknown> the idea that we can use <unknown> <unknown> , and we 're using <unknown> <unknown> , we 're now seeing a <unknown> <unknown> long term , and we can <unknown> <unknown> joy .
and , to take the same time on this memories , you know , there 's a couple of people , maybe some people who have a human or a human other brain , who are <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
people who may seem to remember much more detail , if i do n't see any time in the situation , and they tell them , and i said , but , what do you know ?
this is , there 's a certain , a <unknown> , so somebody who 's in the middle of the world , and it 's a <unknown> <unknown> , which is a <unknown> sign , and then rome is not going to be
and it 's not sort of like this , and there 's a <unknown> , no , every single one , every single wall , every single window , every single window , every single window he has seen a different window he 's going to go back , he could have
where does this come now ?
so why ca n't we , we can not do this , it 's almost close to the fact that the <unknown> is more than access to the <unknown> percent <unknown> .
now we 're also using it yet , but why ca n't i remember doing this in the back of the night , yesterday , i remember n't going to remember the <unknown> of the night in night , in all of the details ?
<unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> from me about interesting experiences of me about interesting things .
he once started to take the <unknown> in the law , and he was working with a <unknown> that was <unknown> its own nature , that was n't more <unknown> , the <unknown> <unknown> of the brain , which is not
wonderful , so that 's very good at the very clear thing , and so that 's very good , clear , so that 's very clear , so that 's clear , so i 'm very excited .
but now , it was about making people who make it <unknown> .
there 's a very simple passage , if you can show you , or that this could n't happen to be more active , you could remember the <unknown> of the car , where these people were <unknown> , which is not <unknown> , that 's
and in fact , with this quotation <unknown> , and that was one of the singles who had been written in this sleeve , and i had this thought .
the second thing that i was doing was very , was he had a lady in <unknown> , who told her that mother , who told her mother , he said , `` the mother has got to be <unknown> in la than she was a little bit like the four years .
and she sat on the front page of her mother and her mother read me her mother .
and then he told us , he said , `` well , '' in fact , `` well , '' but again , i 've been just thinking about it .
then she started <unknown> , she was four of the people that was going to be a <unknown> , and she could n't be able to read that back at the time , you can not read this , today , you can do it .
and then she said , he said , she said , `` you told me , i think , i 'm told , `` my mother 's staff . ''
they have actually been a copy of international development in the conversation , where they went to the right , and the way they were looking at the side of the text that was the <unknown> .
so the brain has been as this brain as it was like a <unknown> , as a result of <unknown> , as a result of the picture .
and then she 'd read it , and it could read it , and it could read it , and it could read it , and then it could read it ,
so , we actually have access to this , but we seem to feel like a whole life of life we 're going to have to make <unknown> <unknown> , to not prevent ourselves .
now , we 're not going to have the event , but as we said , `` if you '' a guy 's <unknown> , a bit of a <unknown> , so we 're going to see what we 're saying , what we 're doing , and what we 're doing is <unknown> , and how they 're <unknown>
and , it was now long ago , but if you 're <unknown> <unknown> , ha , <unknown> , and then i would ask them to ask you , just just just just a long time .
and remember , a <unknown> , <unknown> event in the past past , but yes .
take the first thing that comes from what 's coming . what 's going to happen .
and if you do this , you might be sure that you 'll be sure that you 're going to get a visual part of this memory .
but you may have a picture , maybe even a movie , just a way of a film ?
some of all the things are not only about , because we 're doing so that normal , but that 's because we 've seen the first time .
and if you see it , then it can be you that you 're either in the movie , you can see anything else , you know , you see yourself in a screen , you like in a screen .
we 'll call it a <unknown> , which is a <unknown> , the other <unknown> <unknown> .
thank you very much , you can solve the question again , then you can get to be able to take the eyes back to the back .
because what has got a visual information , you get a visual information , go to the hand , hand ?
yes , there 's a <unknown> for a few hands , and that 's the third side of the way i say , but that 's what i think is that we 're doing something about what we 're doing is that we 're doing
well , take yourself , to keep a <unknown> .
<unknown> is what 's beautiful to the memories of behavior , if you 're memories , it 's not just the memory , it 's a <unknown> event , and i 'm going to go , and i think it 's like that , but we 've never seen
and what 's interesting to do is what 's going to do now .
<unknown> <unknown> was , but i mean , our brains do n't make the difference in the place where we actually have to imagine , and what we 're looking at , we know what we 're doing .
and you can do it , if you 're going to go home and go to the same thing that it 's not happening , that 's not going to be interesting information , something like something , if you remember , what 's going on in the beginning .
and , you know , you know , these stories that you 've got to do is to take this stories of <unknown> <unknown> , from the back of the time , and then back at the back of the time .
and then , then , as it turns out , and that 's what it was , and that 's so nice , and the other data that we have the stories , there 's the people that we 've been much more likely to be much more important , because there 's still a lot more confident , and it was
if we do it in the science , so we 're actually changing our memories , what we do n't we do n't we think about , how do we do ?
<unknown> , when i came here , i was showing my uncle a picture of a hut , from my <unknown> in his hut in switzerland ,
a very beautiful image , it 's also a very nice victim of a <unknown> , and it 's also a very beautiful roots .
just , this image is <unknown> little bit more beautiful than the shack , so it 's an honor freedom , and it 's a <unknown> <unknown> over the time , and that 's a beautiful dog at the time , and that 's the blue dog at the time , and that 's
and why do n't we do that , because of our own thoughts , our own memories , i know what , what do i do that , when i do this very few , what i think they 're doing ?
you 've actually had an ability to make a decision that is a kind of freedom of being a personal thought of thinking .
<unknown> , you know , some people you 've seen you in the morning , if you look like you , you just have so far eyes , what is the other ?
i 've been eating <unknown> , i was being told of his life , i was always going to come into the whole <unknown> of the head .
really , really , the whole night and this thought , did n't really go back to me , and i thought i did n't want to go back to the same time .
i think it 's the way he 's the world he did n't think that he did n't go out of the idea of the idea .
the son <unknown> friend me was a bit of a <unknown> friend when he came to germany , because he was singing his mother in <unknown> , and he just lays them out .
so the father has made , so he has been told his son and <unknown> , or have asked me , or have a question , what was the most important thing that 's happened ?
what the most important thing is , the idea , just once , and then he once told you , he has written it , it has already <unknown> , and it 's just a story about what 's interesting .
and in the two weeks , it was <unknown> , two weeks ago .
and then it was so obvious that the <unknown> path is to come back to visit us , and then you come back to visit me again .
and the reason that is now that all of the whole thing is , that 's the whole shared thing about what 's been doing is that one 's today is one of the most important people who i know .
so they 're not the memories that we affect ourselves , and how we are , it 's our focus on our focus on our minds we use , we think , we think , we think , we think , we think ,
and how we 're going to spend a lot of energy , and we 're going to use it to the world or use it .
so if you 're <unknown> <unknown> thoughts and say , `` this was 20 , '' that 's not what i 'm going to do is , you know , you might say , `` you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
what 's the ones we 're doing is we 're <unknown> , '' and , what beautiful beautiful <unknown> is there , <unknown> , yeah , i 've got to do the <unknown> of the music , and that was that beautiful , so it was beautiful ,
and then take the same thing .
take your <unknown> and take your <unknown> and take the <unknown> .
or if you 're a <unknown> , you know , <unknown> , it 's <unknown> your her head , or your wife , or you , <unknown> , you know , <unknown> , you know , <unknown> , you know ,
so , take a picture , i think this image , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , and she 's also , hey .
<unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> with <unknown> <unknown> , let 's jump on the background foot , and you laugh , why do you laugh ?
because they think about it because they think about it because they thought , because these thoughts are funny , so that thought that 's funny , so what 's funny is about this point .
and you can spend a lot better better at the situation , and you can start to all sorts of things that you 've been doing , and you can do it , and you can do it , and you can do it , and you can do it , and you can do it , and you can do it , and you can do it , and you can do it , and you can do
so , so , why men all do <unknown> <unknown> ?
no , i think our brains have so much capacity to make so much that it can be <unknown> , so it can be <unknown> .
it 's nothing because we can choose to understand how much we can understand how much we think of how much our design , how we think a legacy , a memory , a memory , it 's a <unknown> , it 's coming on us .
so my <unknown> of you , play with the images in your head , you use the power of your <unknown> , and give them a wall of every day that you 're doing .
good afternoon .
thank you very much for the invitation .
if i asked myself to talk about one party , i know , i 'm going to go to my work and i would say that i can go through a <unknown> , and i would like <unknown> eyes , and i see him in eyes , and i see him in the brain of <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> and <unknown> , and
if i then <unknown> the <unknown> to the mast for classical music , '' the <unknown> of the people 's paintings from right now , long <unknown> in a place where the <unknown> is <unknown> , and very , the power of art .
frank gehry was once said to talk about music to love how to feel about the architecture of dance .
so , in fact , what we 're doing is we 're doing something like what we 're doing .
so you can get a glimpse of what i 'm talking about today is , i 've got to share a little film .
film `` film '' geologists .
there 's a lot of the <unknown> , it 's a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> that 's <unknown> .
that 's what it brings the best story of my view of the point of view , and the point of the point is that you 're going to be able to get out of the point of the right now .
since then , <unknown> <unknown> are the <unknown> of the <unknown> magic to make something completely different .
we 're so in the middle of the world today , and we 're in the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of life , and they started a early in our youth , which is the early force and pleasure to <unknown> music
but we also have the study that the <unknown> of the <unknown> and the <unknown> of the <unknown> and the <unknown> of us feel a joy of thinking , well , a little <unknown>
and we are the belief that we believe that the so-called war in the film music is not the same music of the science , so on the music , but in the music , but in their <unknown> .
so we imagine the question , how we can make a <unknown> that the music is near , the friends and those power we 've been doing so much like you .
how can we organize a <unknown> that <unknown> that the world works the world of <unknown> , <unknown> ?
we imagine the parameter that they know from the classic concert , the time , space , time , light , environment , basically , to ask .
so for example , imagine that the relationship between the audience and the musicians , and musicians , and musicians , and musicians , and so musicians .
there 's the largest between the stage and the <unknown> is a chasm of the stage and the audience gives a swing place .
we 're trying to take the power of the power .
here 's a picture of our <unknown> of our <unknown> .
the musicians sit in the audience , whether it 's in beer , beer in the way with the audience with the audience , are in the audience , to play , and some of them are two , they are back in the audience .
and the whole thing is going to be a little bit of a <unknown> in the summer of the evening of the evening of the evening , and then you 're going to be a little bit of a <unknown> .
everybody , the magic has been <unknown> , comes on the stage and come back to the stage and come back .
and that 's the same in the concert hall .
in the course of the <unknown> concert is so much about them or less confusing , and the audience like this , you see , you see here , she looks like this , and look at the moment and watch it .
but there 's music , now , there 's no good ending , there 's actually not always jealous still .
and we 've done to think about how we have to do this , how to you can get this way up .
if you sit up and you can sit on a different perspective , you can put a little piece of paper , and you hear the logical way to make different different ways .
so again , we 're going to be at the concert of a concert , and in this concert , but four <unknown> around the audience is a second thing .
the equations of the doctors were <unknown> the audience all the way they were doing , and they were able to <unknown> the audience .
so in the night , everybody was in the front row in the first row .
it 's important for us to be not just just a little bit of a <unknown> , but that we think of music , '' but we 're thinking about music .
so we ask questions that fish and <unknown> , but also , in the future of people , the music must be the music , you can also be able to figure out them ?
and so then , in the back of the back , at the time , at the time , at the time , at the time , at the time , at the end of the <unknown> p.m. , in the <unknown> , the nation will actually be <unknown> by <unknown> , in <unknown> , in <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> .
but not only the spaces are going to be and the waves can be music to live music and still , but also , the connection with other <unknown> .
and so we 're pretty happy that we 've been working on a few years ago that we 've been working on with the <unknown> of the <unknown> , which are starting to make us with us , and create movement to <unknown> , which is not really easy to dance .
and so then then , then they 've been <unknown> for <unknown> <unknown> , and the <unknown> of steve reich .
and in this year , we have a <unknown> , but if we wanted to be a <unknown> , if you want to go , too , <unknown> your <unknown> , too .
we first have a first time of a <unknown> , and we 've been able to <unknown> a concert <unknown> with a <unknown> game .
we 've been the story of the internet of <unknown> <unknown> with the <unknown> of <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> and just <unknown> <unknown> to a <unknown> <unknown> .
that 's also about the way of thinking , because it had a big deal with <unknown> , and we had a big <unknown> that have been forced us into this piece of time that we 've been doing in this piece of
we 've got a lot of a lot of money in a lot of money from people , and they 've been able to put it out of the <unknown> of this year , so we could put this <unknown> <unknown> .
in this case , this is something that a story is something which is something that is moving from a community , which is <unknown> from a community .
we 're totally happy to live close to <unknown> <unknown> in the gulf of <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> a day .
so the city is so very large that we 're very good and <unknown> places for the very early places , but also so small that we can use the
when the start in the spring of the year , in the spring of two weeks , there are <unknown> in europe , and it 's just going to be able to think that the people more people are using things more than they could do more than they could do more than they could do more than they could do more than they could do more than they could do .
the whole <unknown> is <unknown> <unknown> .
we 're a <unknown> series of <unknown> and students , students , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , really , totally completely understood .
and to make a <unknown> <unknown> , which is the <unknown> , or <unknown> and funding in the eye , you can put a <unknown> to a <unknown> of a <unknown> in a <unknown> scanner that has been <unknown> for a long time to make long tasks .
so , <unknown> , but they 're just going to be a year for a year that we 've been able to take the <unknown> or the <unknown> , the <unknown> , the <unknown> in the hands of the hands are in the hands of the hands , and to become a <unknown> .
we 're doing this in the very good and more of our own lives and life in the germany , and in the <unknown> in the <unknown> .
that means that the biggest part of the work is focused on and work on a <unknown> , and in a <unknown> , and it 's a <unknown> .
only three times over the year , we 're going to be <unknown> by a <unknown> weekend , <unknown> , to another problem , and those other things that are showing , and also , to the well-being , that 's easy to think about it .
for a <unknown> , i 'm going to be a <unknown> to a volunteer volunteer , which for a few weeks , or a few weeks , and you can help them , and then <unknown> , to help , to <unknown> , to <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> ,
and of course , in this record , you know , in the 1930s , the musician 's coming on it , and so in the musician , they come to the musicians .
now , you could say , `` well , you could all be anything that you need to take anything you have a <unknown> machine for you .
but our <unknown> is still going to go further .
and we 've been doing a lot of community in <unknown> , and in fact , in the city of a city , around us , around us , to create us that we want to make us know what we want to do .
this is the classic <unknown> , but that 's also about all sorts of things like the human , the voice , there 's a baker that is us with bread with a <unknown> , or a <unknown> that we can make us
the <unknown> is going to be in a <unknown> area in the city in the city around the year , over the year and over the year , and it sold millions .
to the <unknown> , until the <unknown> <unknown> .
we 've found a whole series of brains that we found ourselves in the living room , to make the nurses to connect the musicians to the promise of the mirror .
and in this kind , the way that the game is to be in the city , and it 's going to be in this city , and from people in the city in this city .
they 're also blessed in a very special way of a kind of <unknown> and a way of a <unknown> , and this way , and this kind of <unknown> with this panel .
since the early years of , we were able to replace the support of the citizen of a government to the <unknown> of a <unknown> place to a <unknown> in life , which is now <unknown> to the whole thing in a <unknown> and a <unknown> <unknown> .
we 're from the <unknown> belief that the music of music that i 'm reading music , classical music , '' when you come to come into the right hand .
so we 're incredibly happy about that in a young young musician , living in your own hand , home home in the cities , and home in the cities .
if you still have n't even able to imagine so as you know , to feel like music is to read music music , then you just go back to the bottom .
next time we are again in the back of the next year , we 're back in <unknown> , and we would be happy if they were there .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn , learn , learn , so , well , learn , and moses , learn .
you might think of yourself , `` you might know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
you know , for example , or for example , to learn , or what 's learning to learn , or i think , for example , to talk about , is to talk about a lot more , more likely to <unknown> , and also <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> .
knowledge experience experience <unknown> , a nice formula , the beautiful formula for the <unknown> .
what i 've learned from art and culture , and there 's a lot of course of course to say , i can say , `` well , i 'm afraid , <unknown> <unknown> , i 've been <unknown> in this field .
and so i thought that it would be really important to think that this <unknown> <unknown> , another <unknown> , to give another <unknown> , what my talk about is my story .
art is beautiful , power but it 's a lot of work , and so , working with work .
now , you 've also been wondering , well , you know , well , you know , well , you know , well , you know , you know , laugh , you know , ok , well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
you always always see laughter , though most of the people know , the familiar guys knows .
why is this ?
i think that 's what you think about that in the word that the great thing is a little bit more powerful , which we ca n't do to do that right now .
art , that 's why we say that sometimes sometimes , that 's why we 've just known what 's going to be what 's going to be like what 's going on .
and we 're going to say that , we 're going to say that , we 're going to say that , what we call that , that 's what we 've been doing is that what we 've done is , what 's what we 've been doing , what 's the case , what we 've done about , what is the case that we 've done like this .
sometimes , sometimes , again , sometimes , again , sometimes , again , sometimes , again , sometimes , again , sometimes , too , too .
the people who want to do , who are working with , who are doing what 's going to do , which is what they 're doing , which is for me , what i 'm thinking about , for me , for me , '' which is for me for me .
but in work , we think about the world , and we 're about the world rather than the realm of the life of what we are moving to our lives , our experiences , we 're moving our own thoughts .
and so i 've been doing my <unknown> , which i want to share with you , about about three hours in five places that have all the <unknown> , and i think , is just that it 's just for it .
it starts with the <unknown> , for the childhood , is on the inspiration , i 'm going to be all of all of my youth , i 'm not going to tell you all of my youth , not worry about , and then , i 'm going to say , `` the word i 'll tell you that i was going to have
the interaction for the first part of my body life , and i have been , the two people , and finally , 20 , identification , <unknown> .
<unknown> of one of them will be shown here to get these pieces of <unknown> <unknown> , which is the <unknown> <unknown> .
<unknown> , two and <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> .
you learn it in the first two , three years , three years ago , if you 're <unknown> a little bit , and i 've got a few pies .
and so , 10 years ago , i 've been building these little pieces , on the piano , not far from here , not home , to <unknown> <unknown> .
these pieces of life in a <unknown> life of a <unknown> .
there 's a <unknown> , and it 's a different voice , and the other voice <unknown> , but it 's very different .
the rhythm is the same thing , but it 's <unknown> , but it 's <unknown> .
and the ladies and gentlemen , is something that 's the same time , and when it 's only like the voices , you 're going to be able to think of the future , the future , the future , the future , the most important is to do the point of
and i learned that two people are sometimes three , sometimes three times , to play the <unknown> , to play each other , but somehow , you know , some of the <unknown> , the other thing , the other thing is not a chance .
and that was what i was doing , which was , i 've been doing , of course , i think , of the other thing , i think , is different aspects .
i have spent experience , i have never forgotten the experience , and i 've ever been able to worry about the occasion that maybe maybe i could go to the same thing .
i 've made piano <unknown> , it was more people in the room as a while today , and in the middle of the <unknown> , i came out .
i realized it was a fear .
i played a bow .
so back back backwards , and in the same way , i did n't even go back to the same thing .
the audience has more <unknown> as i , because i went to my life on my room , she got my pants , and she started the third time of the back .
and they do n't believe they 're not thinking about how they were attracted to me .
but this was a very tough experience .
maybe it was also one of the experiences i knew , well , with a piece of music , although i had a quick <unknown> , i should n't have to be my <unknown> , but if you can get easier to get it .
yes , the next chapter of my favorite stories of my favorite thing i 've been doing is i 'm working on inspiration , and i 'm going to tell you about stories about that .
when i was a <unknown> , i went to my <unknown> , and i said to him , i was told , `` i 'd like to play a little bit more <unknown> .
and he said , susan , he said , `` oh , this does n't mean . ''
and so you have to have a lot of <unknown> <unknown> , and a lot of experience has been <unknown> , and a lot of experience with women have been touched by women , and so many experiences have been collected together .
now , imagine a <unknown> young man , so , a young young man , so , young , so , my age , so sentence , so sentence , so , a sentence .
but i did n't forget about the fact of course , i did n't forget about that .
and from one of these , i 've been able to get more than a few more finely .
i was now being used to myself , by the way , in a <unknown> , '' and i was in a <unknown> , and i was a way of a <unknown> .
i 've met a lot , and i remember reading a situation that i 've never seen before .
it was the <unknown> of the <unknown> of chopin , and now i 'm going to be part of the work , and it was n't the most mysterious , very long , and you had to do the same thing , and then you go through the legs , and then it goes back together and
i 'm not there today , i do n't know , i 'm not going to play it , i 'm not going to be a piano here , and i 'm not a piano here , and i could n't even do it anymore .
i 've been doing this place , 20 years , <unknown> , and then , once , and suddenly , you 've got to get it up .
and then i 'd like you to go and put it , and i <unknown> myself in a <unknown> , and i knew only that i would always come up to the ground and thought of it .
i was a tragic thing .
i had n't have nothing out of nothing , nothing that was , and the music did it so that , and i did n't know anything like this .
a experience where i 've learned , i think , really , really , really <unknown> , and <unknown> really <unknown> .
and sometimes it 's really really to work for that you 're in the <unknown> , and in this case , i think it 's time , is the <unknown> .
where all of the things go , you 're going to be done by the self .
we also have this really <unknown> in the field of technology in a organization called a <unknown> in a organization .
and then it was almost like ours , as we did the <unknown> , and we took the two months of <unknown> where they could n't have for a year or a half years .
now , these were my stories with the piano , with the physics , to decide , in particular , with some work , with <unknown> work .
and now i 'm going to come to my school , <unknown> , i 'm <unknown> .
i was first , as a first time , i was first starting to make a musician , but it was just as a <unknown> , but it was just as a <unknown> .
we 've studied <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> .
i 've got a <unknown> , and i 've been doing this , and i 'm sure that i 'm going to be proud of my own computer for the music for the music , and the <unknown> had had the <unknown> .
in the choir , <unknown> breathe , <unknown> , a <unknown> singing , wonderful experiences that i 've been doing , i think , are very , very quickly .
and then one thing that i was looking at the <unknown> theater , the <unknown> , and the <unknown> , and i was doing this with <unknown> , that this painting came from , and this particular thing was , in the <unknown>
and the art of the culture , to make culture , to make culture to be a <unknown> .
so here , you know , working on art , but it 's not as artists , but , you might not say , `` maybe you would n't say , `` but <unknown> <unknown> and doing something .
i was there in the theater , and i was <unknown> , in germany , there was no <unknown> for <unknown> , and i 've been a lot of time to get to work with the question of art , to make art design for art , to make a good health
and that was the reason i was also going to be rejected by my own kids , in a <unknown> , and i 've been working on a <unknown> , and i 've been working on a <unknown> .
but before she was one of the other <unknown> , and that since the phase , i 've been <unknown> , and this phase , i 've got <unknown> with the <unknown> with interaction .
i went to <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , and i was <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
the german <unknown> <unknown> has its <unknown> <unknown> in <unknown> <unknown> .
i 'm a <unknown> , although sometimes in my abdomen , because i was born in <unknown> , i 'm born with <unknown> , and i 'm going to <unknown> my <unknown> <unknown> , i 'm going to tell me a little bit more .
but i have a <unknown> root , because my grandparents were <unknown> , and there , in <unknown> , i 've been able to find the <unknown> .
and i was worried about what i did n't do , and i suddenly became a whole place in a new form of culture , in a culture , a culture , has been coming from people in this <unknown> device
once the <unknown> of the <unknown> on us were <unknown> , all of us were all of a very different situation , in a different way , in the other thing , in the other states , in the other universe , and in some other states .
and i then put in <unknown> , who 's future <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , who was my friend and colleague , where we did for the <unknown> evening , he 's playing with a <unknown> , and another piano , i was able to put
we made the <unknown> <unknown> , so , of course , but of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , the <unknown> of the <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> .
and this <unknown> , that actually came out of the whole thing , which was actually taken out of the people .
it was my destiny , i was <unknown> at the winter of muhammad <unknown> , and i was not <unknown> , and i did n't even know that the wall fell .
i woke up the next day , i had <unknown> <unknown> , i said , <unknown> , the wall is a <unknown> , '' and the wall is a little bit , but it 's a wall , yeah .
i 've always been happy to come up with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a question for a question for a question for the <unknown> .
and then i was a <unknown> for the city of the south cities for the united states in the <unknown> , and i was a <unknown> .
and i have a lot of time , how little like this is how much like interactions interactions are two billion cultures , two thousand cultures , and in the other cultures , as a half years .
and we 're talking about the same language , the music is going to be wonderful and wonderful , but lots of <unknown> , <unknown> .
so when the <unknown> was n't all about the same , but it was a lot of the top , and so i 've been able to get a big measure to see how the german identity , i started to go back to the bottom line and then
since the germany is about <unknown> germany , the <unknown> <unknown> is <unknown> .
since , it 's since the time , and they 're also more more sophisticated than the <unknown> lot more sophisticated places .
so , i 've learned how many of these things have been learned from all of these things , and i 've learned to live in the city .
we 've been out of the end of this , i was a <unknown> , imagine that , when i started here , i was <unknown> here , i was <unknown> on my <unknown> <unknown> of culture and <unknown> .
i 've been doing this one .
good for the time , for <unknown> , you did n't want to write <unknown> <unknown> for culture and <unknown> <unknown> .
i was the first director of the <unknown> . i was the first director of the <unknown> .
so i did n't have so much , so the wonderful thing that i had was that i had this <unknown> , but they soon succumbed , because i was able to do that , and i could have been able to do the public and i could make it
we 've done a lot of the financial crisis , we 've only seen this <unknown> between the <unknown> , and you see what we 've done in the <unknown> , and the <unknown> can be able to see of the <unknown>
many , many interactions , we could have and i 've been working and i 've found , and i realized what was that if i think , what 's that that means , what would be , as a different way of different parts of the
and you also think that more generally more of the art , more and more important to culture that are us to tell us the <unknown> between people , between cultures , between communities , and then i think back to the art
interaction was also the way that the problem with the <unknown> of the <unknown> as we were , <unknown> , seven <unknown> had the idea , the <unknown> of the <unknown> , that <unknown> would be <unknown> to the <unknown> world .
but this last chapter , this fifth chapter , the chapter chapter , the <unknown> chapter , the <unknown> coined the <unknown> , and i was told that he was <unknown> .
this word has got a <unknown> , for example , i 'm going to <unknown> me to something , and i can also use it as a word and i say , `` i know something , i know something , i know something , i know something .
and in his <unknown> <unknown> , it always has been completely <unknown> into his <unknown> <unknown> .
i know a little bit about it , and i say , `` i 'm going to put you , or i think , or <unknown> or <unknown> , or that community .
and i 'm going to do it , and if i 'm going to leave me , i 'm going to go to the <unknown> and say , i 'm going to argue , and i 'm going to be able to identify with you , i want to identify with me .
and that 's a very big clue .
five seconds three of the world is trying to move forward , to create new cities , to identify in the way it 's in the way it 's in the way it 's in the way it 's in the way it 's in the way it 's in the way it 's a sense of view , and to realize that you can create a community in europe .
as big , we called the <unknown> , but even as a community of many people who live in a large <unknown> and i even telling a shared language , if the world 's disease and then , and so that was our development
in sign , the signs of the highway , the <unknown> of the soviet union , many other moments of us .
a wise thing about the <unknown> of the <unknown> , i did n't have the most <unknown> of the people have n't seen so many people have been doing so many people .
there 's a <unknown> , and <unknown> , two schools , who 's professor girls , who was <unknown> , and <unknown> students from a <unknown> school , and <unknown> <unknown> , who were <unknown> , and <unknown> , who have been talking about , <unknown> , <unknown> , children who have to be
and it was a special effect that young girl 's boyfriend , and young married people , and some pink authors have been married letters from girls from germany , in a <unknown> german .
and so , i 've been able to put this out of this young men in the piano , and i was able to put this <unknown> that i love so much as i loved so fast .
and in fact , he was from a letter , and i said , `` i 'm a <unknown> , he wrote him home , when he was a kid playing , and i ca n't play a <unknown>
and he <unknown> his finger with a <unknown> , sat back to the piano in the screen in this building on <unknown> , and tried to play the <unknown> <unknown> .
and he did n't have him .
it was for me that a little fan that i was looking at me , and i just said , `` i said , what did we actually learn from ?
we 've learned that the way we learned , in many ways , there 's a lot of people working together , but before all of us , we learned that we have a lot of <unknown> in <unknown> and culture , that we 're not going to be able to do something that we can now be able to feel
and that was a real experience , and you see , it 's something that 's going on , you 're not going to be able to learn something that you 're not doing something that you know about something .
it 's always learning to learn something that is to find something that 's being <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> .
and if we take a lot of generosity , and we 're going to give it the way to connect us to work with art and culture , our own way , to work together , and then we have to communicate the way to work with the
and i hope that they hope many of the most competitive people and <unknown> , who have come to this <unknown> .
thank you very much .
yes , thank you very much .
i think we can wait a quick voyage to the first image .
so i have to take a <unknown> of a <unknown> of my own <unknown> show just a few days of <unknown> here .
but it 's not a scientific computer , but it 's in my <unknown> , and i 'm going to go to find a way , and i think about how to change the subject of where i think we 're going to be doing the next few years .
and the most of the <unknown> words i 've been doing , i 've been doing , `` well , i think , is that , i 'm thinking about , why i think , in the way , '' and i think , in a technological <unknown> , we can actually be able to get this talk to the <unknown> .
and then i had to think about it in english , if somehow , but if you look at it , you see , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , i do n't know what i did n't know , i 'm not going to say , `` i 've never heard the old <unknown> , and so i 've been doing the next to say ,
how we 're going to die , we will die , die like that .
i 've got to tell you about the first time of <unknown> .
<unknown> was a patient in the hospital that i was the <unknown> of the <unknown> , which i was <unknown> the <unknown> , and i was <unknown> the <unknown> <unknown> , and i was <unknown> .
she was about <unknown> years old and it was always considered to be happy in the way , but because she also entered this man , the first man who was in the first man who was in the war in the war .
and so she was every single year , and she was a first time playing in a dance , and she was a little bit more comfortable , and then , if you 're a <unknown> <unknown> , and it 's coming , and then , on the right side , you see the <unknown> , you 're looking at the blood , the blood vessels , the <unknown> .
and a few years before she was just once , she had been even on the same way , and she had a lot of other things that had the same thing , and the whole left of the sun is broken .
and then i was also there a year and i 've been working on a doctor and saw her <unknown> at the age of how she was used to work , and he started the building , and he learned the discussion that would be wrong , is that , what i mean , was
does it really make sense to think that old people of this people 's <unknown> such a way to make a very special approach to a <unknown> approach to the <unknown> ?
so , to think of <unknown> , who 's the <unknown> age at weeks , who 's a person at the <unknown> <unknown> ?
and it 's been used indiscriminately .
five years later , i come to the clinic , the name of <unknown> , and i can make it all the time , because he 's just a lot of time , and it was just the way to make the dance leg , and then his dance is broken the same leg ,
so the question is , what i think is , what i 'm going to do is i think about if i think about how to any matter of what a person should be , what is to write in the <unknown> , what he 's doing in <unknown> <unknown> , or what he 's also <unknown> ?
and this is so much of a <unknown> , and the thing that is a bit of a <unknown> of the <unknown> .
you see the <unknown> of the <unknown> of the `` kind of <unknown> , '' we 're going to die , and we 'll die to be lost .
it 's a book from the <unknown> of how we can work , a report on the <unknown> , ''
and then it was that the globalization was very much at the fact that you were wondering , how can we go to work out ?
and then they 've been , and you can just imagine that in the book , and then you know , it 's going to be a <unknown> , you will get a blood vessels .
it 's going to be a change of work , it 's still going to be much more difficult to be much more difficult , for example , china , for example , that 's a big topic .
and that 's also , that 's basically the work that has to do something that 's something that has been something that 's been born , and it 's been <unknown> that 's going to be still difficult to the quality that he 's <unknown> , from the point
and that , after my passions , people were going to be less depressed from their work , and they were more part of a little <unknown> , where it was to make the high high school , and not more than to do with their work .
and if we 're now going to now see now , in the process of the <unknown> and medical institute , and there 's obviously a kind of <unknown> , and that 's why we have , and , of course , is , that 's how we have .
if you start talking to the music , why doctors doctors , <unknown> doctors and <unknown> <unknown> most of the <unknown> , then they 're called the so-called <unknown> .
and this is nothing that we have to be prepared to do what you did , and it 's going to be paid to get it on , and if i 'm not to say , the medical service is to be able to do that , or the medical treatment , we ca n't
and so , these interiors are going to be the work of the <unknown> and more fun , and more importantly , that 's what you have to do is work for the work and personal <unknown> , and the <unknown> against the <unknown> against the <unknown> , and the <unknown>
a good friend of mine was now coming to juarez , because he wanted to do this with a few years , and we had a <unknown> that worked with a <unknown> , and then she went to <unknown> , and to go to the doctor , to be a <unknown>
the <unknown> industry is a <unknown> , and they 've been in a book , and it 's an article that i was thinking about old people 's women who were born between the <unknown> , a long time , and the <unknown> , because she did n't know what it was to do when they were
then the nest bears are going to come to the hospital , you 're back to the <unknown> , or the <unknown> , and will get to the more <unknown> .
and this <unknown> , i was thinking about this if there 's a little bit of <unknown> in mexico , then i want to ask me to go back to something that you can put out of this vicious <unknown> of the <unknown> and the <unknown> <unknown> of people
well , in 1995 , he had to be able to hear the point when he had a lot of time with a lot of time he had learned the same thing happened , which was happening there , which was happening in this <unknown> .
it 's also also going to be increasingly <unknown> , and it 's also increasingly <unknown> , which die , and they 're growing increasingly <unknown> , as they were growing up in their own brain .
it 's not the <unknown> that are the <unknown> , but you even have a chance to find a place , i want to be a <unknown> for the <unknown> , not just like a <unknown> , or not a <unknown> , if i 'm in the middle of the <unknown> .
and then the <unknown> is going to be going to be the <unknown> .
in '96 , it 's like the third days , when we 're going to happen to the <unknown> , and then you need to take a <unknown> , i want to go into the hospital , or i do n't want to go to the hospital if i do n't want to go to the hospital if something would be
so , so , that 's what i want to do , i 'm going to be generous , or i do n't want to be <unknown> and be going to be a <unknown> .
this data is going to come to a central place , and there 's this doctor 's <unknown> for the time , and it always has the <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> the decision on this platform , and then the decision on this platform .
now , if we 've been talking about <unknown> , who likes to love with the strange journalist , and even once , and imagine that there was no inclination for a <unknown> , i would n't have a <unknown> in the audience , and then they could
and the final thing that i 've been doing is that i 've been doing in the truck , and then you 're also a lot of <unknown> in a <unknown> , also , a lot of <unknown> <unknown> , and how much it was to help with it .
in the last time , there are <unknown> <unknown> about 300 percent of people who were not dying home , but in these , they 're not <unknown> , so that 's <unknown> , and it 's a <unknown>
there are really <unknown> that are very well , there are very <unknown> people who are being used , but if i 'm going to go through the <unknown> , and i 'm about a lot of patients who i could say , `` i think , to be honest , to give it
and the whole thing of course , of course , is that , but the reason that is , it 's a very complex system , and the control is that we 're not going to have to do that , because the people who are going to be used for the marathon , and that the <unknown> of the children are being used to be a child , or i think
it 's just not the real time , but it takes two foundations of the <unknown> , and <unknown> , and most of the time it is just <unknown> .
this research of the <unknown> of the protein is a <unknown> marketplace , which is the ability to play the way that we want to connect , so that 's the way that they 're doing , all the way they 've been doing , so that 's all the ones of the ones .
and now , i think , you can , you know , you can take a <unknown> , so what we 're doing is now , because what i 've been told you , because i 've been thinking of yourself , and that 's exactly what 's really simple , that 's not the situation for the things that you do n't understand .
and i just just <unknown> the <unknown> <unknown> and the articles of me , i think that society will help us create a lot of virtual , but also the structures that we can all do that , and what we find that we 're going to
and in the <unknown> article , one of the article , i was thinking about this , and this is the way , which was the people of the people who are <unknown> , is the <unknown> of the people 's <unknown> .
and the second sentence there is to protect them is to protect the task of the <unknown> , and the <unknown> of all the <unknown> , is that it 's a <unknown> .
and what i 'm sometimes suggesting is a third sentence in there , and that one of the rest has been given to the goal , to be able to protect his own and to defend their own , and defend the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest
because this is a way of being imbued by some of the way , and i give it a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a <unknown> , and i 've been able to do something like that , and i have a hard time and then i do n't need to think about it , i 'm
because the last thing is , but if we do n't like to do n't think about this topic , we 'll get to get to the point in the point .
hopefully until long , it 's just until a hundred or a hundred or a <unknown> , and <unknown> <unknown> .
and so , i think , of course , i 'm going to do that , i mean , i wish to thank you , and i 'll end up to pretend to be a little bit of a <unknown> , or <unknown> , it 's not late in his life , say , `` i can do
now , if you think about what 's going to do , what 's going to come up , you 're going to come to dots where you 've got on the audience , what are the five important things in my life ?
there are now a book called a book called <unknown> , which is very <unknown> <unknown> .
it 's the musical side , and it 's the friends that i 've been working with who i 've been working on to work and help the people who know me , and i 'm going to have the <unknown> .
it 's safe to trust the people between people who i could do , in a <unknown> or a carrot or a carrot or a <unknown> , or another person , or i think other people , with whom i can live in health .
and there are many of the thousands of individuals that are there that are the ones that i 've been doing , and i 'm not going to do not all do this with all of all of all , and i do n't have all the things that we 're not going to do it all .
but if you look at these three points , you 've got a lot of tasks , you 've got a lot of tasks , you might have to have a <unknown> in the life of the world , but if you need to have to do it , to save his own
and then , there 's another factor that we 're going to experience a certain degree of the <unknown> experience , i 've been doing this , as a result of text or as a look at how this is a result of the way .
other people can make it for us to make these decisions and the behaviors that what they 're doing , and i could n't do , and i do n't know , and i do n't know , and i do n't know , and i do n't know , and i do n't know , and i do n't know , and i do n't know ,
this is my view of the belief .
and we would have just two of us , we can only come from us from us .
so it 's not the question , `` other people i do , who will be , do , for your life , or to help me , who will be willing to me ?
it 's just as a way to start , at the end , i can think of people , where i can do it , and i 've been able to do it in my mind , i can use this question and ask it to the
and if you 're going to say , what we 're going to do , is this inside of the <unknown> <unknown> that 's been <unknown> from outside , it 's a way to say , my <unknown> would be <unknown> my life ,
because no human can pay me to me , i would feel like i was looking at it , and i want to go to the way , and i want to go , and i want to go .
and i do n't have to put it in a <unknown> or a <unknown> that you say , you know , you 've got to be a <unknown> ring , and because you 're so old , you can see if you want to be a <unknown> , you want to be able to be a
so , i think that questions i 'm going to do is only think of a long term for a long term , and i think i could actually easily be able to work on a long term , and i think , well , in the first time , you can do it , and i think , well , in the first time , you can do it , and you can do it , you know
this would be a nonprofit posture of what it is in me and not be able to be able to protect the boundary where the state can not be able to be a way of , and i think that people are <unknown> and me , in which i have
and to make these issues , it 's going to be , and i 've been thinking about this talk , and here we are going to be able to do that in the picture , and i 'm going to have to think about this , and then we 're not going to be able to do it , and that 's a moment that 's not
so we 're going to be old , that 's why , well , as a dance in the invention , and i had to dance in my own , very few , that would be a lot of the things that i 'd like .
thank you very much to make you all your job .
beautiful good evening .
i 'll take two things with me .
if you 're part of the right part of you , you 're going to be a little bit of a <unknown> , you 're going to make a little bit of a <unknown> . ''
it 's still a second .
let 's start with a robot .
this is insane , it 's crazy , it 's not possible , and it can be a <unknown> .
what do you mean , what do you mean ?
is there different kinds of <unknown> brow ?
or is it infinitely enough enough ?
yes !
this is not good when you 're here , one of the one of the one , what 's the right thing . ''
so , in fact , but i 'm thinking , well , i 'm sure it 's because it 's already that for the people who know it .
we do n't really do that . we do n't mean .
we 're just just with a single one , and we 're only one with one , only one .
and i 'm so excited to so for a little bit to a little bit of a <unknown> .
<unknown> , <unknown> , we know , infinity , we know , economically , we know , economically , we know , economically , we have a tendency to know whether we 're going to know about what 's interesting knowledge we know about .
it 's all around the <unknown> around the apartments , which are <unknown> from many different scales of magnitude .
if we 're in the <unknown> , and you 're looking at two <unknown> , a <unknown> , one of the <unknown> , in the other people , and in other people in the other people .
we know , now , we 're looking at it in the box , we look at the box , the number is small , it 's three audio , and it 's three eggs and it 's three people .
we can see we , if we 're going to be if there are any of the amount of life that are in the most common amount of land in the world ?
now , how do we go away ? how would we do it ?
that means we were just the people , we know , we 're three , three , we 're going to take the three , we 're the <unknown> , see three , we 're a three , three , three and three three and three , three
well , what do you mean , yes ?
very nice .
this works , wonderful in the <unknown> , it 's very difficult for big numbers , although it was annoying . although it 's a result of the other numbers , it 's raining .
but it 's going to summarize .
how do you even have it all ?
how do you get the epiphany that people are there , right ?
i 've been aware of it , and i 've been able to see people and people and not what others do .
<unknown> !
you call it the <unknown> !
you know , it 's clear , that 's clear , but we 're now going to go back to the daily and i think it 's all that everybody thinks you 've all had to be all of this !
not , it 's very beautiful .
so , you call it a <unknown> , and i 'm <unknown> to a <unknown> , and it works , right ?
you take one , you put on a chair , the mouse , the mouse .
the next <unknown> , the next <unknown> , all is , <unknown> , small people have different <unknown> , no good space , and the vast ones are very low , right ?
now we 're going to go to the infinite thing .
how can we compare two infinite amounts of devices , then , what can we bring up for a infinite number of two ?
we would say , `` we 're going to be a big or bigger or bigger or less than the other ones .
we could we do it ?
we would start to start talking about again .
right , that 's wrong because the point is that when you start to test in a infinitely long way , i would just say , `` i would just say , you 're not going to go to the other .
<unknown> , infinitely , infinitely , is it , <unknown> , <unknown> ?
so how about it ?
<unknown> ?
no , <unknown> !
but what it did was actually did that , right ? it was really right .
let 's go !
so , now , let 's look at this time .
estimate , it 's always bad bad , and it 's bad , it 's bad , it 's because why it 's been wrong , is n't it ?
you see there , no matter of what is it true , yes ?
the point is , you know , it 's a really simple way to take it right away .
for example , if you take the <unknown> , you can do , the numbers , we 're playing computers , we need computers to the bottom , zero , one , two , four , four , four , five , five , five , five , five .
and we had to say , let me say , just a copy of this <unknown> and take this copy of this <unknown> , tiny different numbers for the numbers of the numbers .
it 's just going to be left , okay , so , you 're all right , zero , zero , two , four , four , eight , eight , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> ?
okay ?
all the top numbers are <unknown> on the warm long band of the natural numbers , but on the one , without a <unknown> , the <unknown> is the <unknown> , the other ones are the curve and the <unknown> <unknown> , right ?
let 's say a lot of 300,000 stages , we call the other amount of extremists , we call the other amount of extremists of the natural numbers .
what do you think ?
is copied more powerful , is it bigger than just , to be a high , <unknown> , or big ?
and how big ?
but it 's very rare , but , in the one , the game is not the <unknown> solution .
who are a number of someone who 's a different estimate ?
small ?
who says , how do you say , if who does n't want to spend ?
ah , this really does n't really have a plan , but yes , do n't really have a plan , yes ?
now , this can also be not the case , yes ?
you ca n't , where do n't get anything , are , what 's the danger , and more , so does n't we all , is n't it , <unknown> ?
okay , so , you say , little , `` you say , little fun ?
would you think , do n't believe ?
that 's the compelling thing that you 're going to say is about wrong , of course , wrong .
and now , now , let me explain why the <unknown> is what they 're going to be the same same thing .
how does it work ? how much ?
it 's exactly .
we 're doing , we 're <unknown> .
this is the point .
we 're going to see you tonight .
we take advantage zero , we 're going to take the zero , and half of the natural gas , we 're <unknown> , no , <unknown> .
the next one zero , after two : two minutes , two two minutes , after one zero , looking at one zero , and i 'm going to talk about a <unknown> , and i 'll talk about a <unknown> .
the four , the four , the six , the six , the six , the six , the six , the six , the six , the three , the three , the three , the four , the four , the four , the <unknown> , right ?
you can also do that , and it 's available , is that , <unknown> , <unknown> ?
and completely clear , by the way we 're doing , by the <unknown> , we can do that , that i 'm going to go to the same way to the legacy of the talks like a <unknown> <unknown> .
and here 's one , there 's only the beginning to be the front door , and the band is the long time , and the band is the long , but it 's the first time , right ?
we <unknown> the natural on the curve , the <unknown> , the <unknown> , the <unknown> is gone , and the band is still a long time and still have a long time .
and it 's just one of the best way that we 're just in the confluence of infinite infinite .
so if you tell some of the things that we learned today , we 've talked about today , yes , what is infinite , because , well , what i mean , i 'm only going to finally ?
a infinity amount of a huge solution that you do n't have to be the <unknown> in the <unknown> , and that 's a strong , is absolute <unknown> , a real <unknown> , which is just a big subset that is just very big .
they do n't make it in the <unknown> , if they were from three three people , and only one of them are still , and only are the three and more , and they were three and more ,
so we have done done so well . so we did it 's <unknown> .
is n't any more labor-intensive ?
okay .
now , we 're still going to do a second part , maybe it 's a chance of probability , and we 're still going to have a second one .
the professionals , genetic causes , the probability of the probability ,
i 've been talking about what 's going to do with me .
and this is a really clear thing that i 'm sure about , at least , there 's at least a third of the third and <unknown> , and it 's someone somebody who was going to be able to put it on this , right ?
so , let 's call it the doors , b , c .
i 'm going to tell you about anything , i hope you 're not heard of this .
now , you 're going to be interesting now .
where , you know , i have to blend , is a hidden , ridiculous or b ?
guess , here we are , here , our <unknown> , here 's a <unknown> , here 's where we 're going to do here .
they claim on c c .
who has another idea of a idea ?
one ?
who has a idea of a idea ?
i mean , <unknown> , b has got a merit , not , not , if you do n't hear it , it 's never going to be <unknown> , is n't it <unknown> , <unknown> ?
it 's true .
it 's really true , so you do n't have to not say , the three letters will be the same letter , and i 'm going to give you a little bit of a little bit .
it 's really true , yeah ?
it 's totally clear , because , the chance that you 've been lucky , is only just about a third .
<unknown> , there are three things , there 's really no matter , right ?
now , i 'm going to show you , i just put a look at a few .
well , i know , of course , of course , i know where it 's because of it .
<unknown> , that 's someone somebody who 's someone , <unknown> , <unknown> .
so , i know , what it is , and it 's about how to think , and guess what it means , and it 's like it , '' and also , it always says it , and it 's called it 's a second round of time .
so i 'm really now going to just mention the game i just just to do now , and i just just <unknown> it , i 'm just going to do it , i 'm just going to play <unknown> .
so it 's so , we 're going to go back to a second round .
now , imagine that i 'm going to go to me , i 'm going to go to a <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> ?
so , now , i have to show a door , and i have to put a door , and you do n't have a door behind the place , which is not what they did n't know .
because if you 're going to come out b , and i say , and i know , it 's not the blue .
then we did n't have a second round .
and then i said , `` i said , <unknown> , '' which was <unknown> , the mouse , happy , <unknown> , <unknown> .
but i have to say , this is <unknown> , and it 's <unknown> , to go back to the second , and i 'm going to go back to the second time .
so i can only do a third , behind that , not only not only , but what they did n't have .
now , the question is , and this is the genetic value , which is the condition of the middle here , under the condition that is open , and it 's not behind the last opportunity to explore new yorker .
you can either be able to stay at a while , i 'm also a <unknown> .
i 'm now going to do what you want to do .
or you say , i say i 'm going to make c c .
now the <unknown> is , is it that we 've gotten more than this knowledge ?
<unknown> , very beautiful , b is on , now i know it 's behind mr. c .
or , but , god , thank you , i was being a transistor , i always always wanted to stay in a piece , and it 's like it .
or , if you say , well , you know , <unknown> , we have <unknown> , just , we 've got two doors , we 've only had two doors , it 's not possible to keep it or keep it .
what do you mean what do you mean ?
it 's not true .
<unknown> .
why is it not any ?
very beautiful .
why is it why ? it 's <unknown> ?
yes , yeah , that 's wrong , exactly , it 's wrong .
what 's almost almost almost as if we had the <unknown> of the <unknown> , yesterday ?
but so they 're , as you 're <unknown> , there 's a new , no one , no one fun , fun of fun , fun .
so , this is the way , the thing is very <unknown> , but it 's <unknown> , yeah .
and all of the things that between the city , i do n't know , six and , i mean , i do n't want to be <unknown> years ago , so i do n't want to be more of all , i 'm not going to go more , <unknown> ?
so it 's really <unknown> . everybody 's all told .
behind this door , it 's about a third side behind the third .
and it 's always a third behind the door behind a door behind a door , and it 's just a box behind the door .
you can guess what you want to do , you 've got , you 've got to have a flood of two thirds of them , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
that means you would have to take the doors , not , you can do it in the <unknown> , you can get to two dozen , you 're all of the <unknown> times , and so on
but here we have a door . here , we just have a door .
so , now , now , this is , there 's two thirds , it 's not what you 're doing .
so the two third here , but it can only be behind the door , `` well , because you 're only behind you .
behind it is n't .
so what 's more of the other ?
no , i did it in a <unknown> !
so what 's more , more , is now more than now ?
it 's better , to stay or should be ?
now it 's just , yes ?
yes , of course , of course !
so , this was n't hard to work , `` well , so what ? ''
ha !
what do we see ?
they 've been happy , she had loved magic .
why ?
simple , two thirds are not a hundred billion percent : the difference between foie gras and practice .
i hope that it 's been interested in everybody , and i hope for everybody .
thank you very much .
lord <unknown> that she was preparing me to sue 's <unknown> , who is just being <unknown> by bad and no food , and people people have to be a <unknown> .
but i 'm a very good job of my best that that then comes back to the whole couple of time , and then , the other thing is all around , they have these little ones .
i come up to <unknown> from the farm farm , and i was going to be at least a luxury of it .
and in fact , the thing that came to me , exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly .
yes , yeah .
thank you for inviting me for today .
i grew up in the back here , and i was coming somewhere .
and i do n't know if mr. <unknown> also was so on the way to ask me , i would like to talk to ted at the beginning of the building , and talk about a particular topic .
i 've got <unknown> <unknown> : i 'm sorry to <unknown> the <unknown> : the trick .
sure , it 's not bad , and i 'm <unknown> to the woman 's <unknown> , who would say , `` if you have a student , or a lot of time , more words , more
i 've also been honored to be very much of the same with a number of years .
so today , the legs are going to go to a long time , but i 've got to train tomorrow , because i 'm in the morning , and i 'm in <unknown> , to <unknown> , to <unknown> , to <unknown> , to <unknown>
and i do n't think that much time you can not do that , when the court do n't work , '' and did n't work on fire training .
so , what i want to do is to do is the <unknown> , <unknown> , is going to go back in the early '90s , in the <unknown> , i 'm going to be risking you all that 's all your hair .
i said , i said , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> to the <unknown> .
and i started to start with <unknown> , <unknown> , with the subject of the <unknown> .
no worry , the great , <unknown> , <unknown> trust is coming out of <unknown> <unknown> .
i was doing this for a long time , when i 'm a <unknown> , how i 'm going to describe the best to where i 'm going to <unknown> ?
so , i come to the village of the village 's six people , many <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , and my parents at the courtyard , apple 's apple , <unknown> and <unknown> -- and what makes you <unknown> from <unknown> : beer .
trust , in the lunchroom , the most important , but i do n't have a <unknown> , but i was n't like , `` <unknown> and beer .
why tell you that story i 'm telling the story where i 'm going to be ?
and i 'm sure that i think , the reason , the very important stories that i really are right to right right from the country , from a village , and it 's been two of the great brothers , and the oldest brother , the <unknown> .
and with the second brother , the same brother that i 'm just blind to me , i 'm sure i 'm going to be .
it 's called , the <unknown> light and dark , and i can see it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can see where the window will see where <unknown> windows in the room , whether it 's light , or it 's light .
what 's interesting is really intriguing , it 's practical , for the <unknown> , is the <unknown> , which is the most important thing for <unknown> .
the way we do , or we 're both right now if we can be a moment of what happens to us , if we 're a little bit of something that is happening to us .
<unknown> <unknown> , but i always say , i 'm always going to make sure that i can not use any other thing , and <unknown> man 's <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
the topic of the old men , <unknown> <unknown> .
and so , until the <unknown> and the half of the <unknown> is gone to go down here .
and what i was interested in , but of course , the fact that the lack of how you trust faith and is that the most trust trust , the <unknown> that we need all kinds of things , and i think it 's
and it has definitely sure that i mean , i mean , it was definitely that for her parents , as many of you , my brother and me never knew nothing for him .
we were so the first thing that we 've been looking at all of the first time , and then we suddenly have quite all in the lives of all , and then , in fact , in the life , is that they are in the life of the other .
and they had to have a way of what they did , in the situation , they have done somehow .
and , now , now i 'm also , it 's a very lucky statement that my parents were not going to have the day of the day , and we can go to the hand or to say , `` so that 's a wall wall , you can go and see <unknown> and
and it would be done so , we 've been a <unknown> -- we 've got to go back to the <unknown> , so we 've got so close to the <unknown> .
and b <unknown> our <unknown> of the beginning of our colleagues to <unknown> us , to go back to where they are our <unknown> brother .
so , in the house alone , the <unknown> of the <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> , <unknown> , also , even more than risk , but it also <unknown> .
and the blind brother 's <unknown> then <unknown> with <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> in a <unknown> , and <unknown> <unknown> , in the <unknown> , is <unknown> <unknown> .
the <unknown> <unknown> i 've been able to do that today , and i 've been able to have to go to the city of space to the time , and i 've been able to have a lot of time to the time .
so that 's the very first time , and the thing that 's the most successful brothers are not just good for the animals , but also for the <unknown> , and the <unknown> , and the <unknown> , and the <unknown> , and the <unknown> ,
and our brothers and the nurses and i have a fascination in the <unknown> , but i really worked out of the way that it was all of all of the things that they could do , what they could do , for the <unknown> , i could go to the <unknown>
and this has been the <unknown> brother of dodo <unknown> with the three weeks , and we wanted to be about the three years , and then we were also to say , michael and i 'm going to be a dancer , and i was .
and have started to start with <unknown> , as a result of the way , many of these <unknown> children , today , <unknown> <unknown> is <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
so to keep the water that can do .
but we 've actually done that in the <unknown> , and we 've actually got to work , at least , without a few years ago .
and then the big question : how much ma are you happy ?
and how do we get the trust , one of the trust of the people who are going to end up at the beach , the children who are going to take a bike back and take the back of the bike and <unknown> the trust of us that we ca n't go anywhere in the
and our solution was , of course , we have to tell you that we have a single person , where we 're a <unknown> , so , where there 's a car , where you 're not a <unknown> , but where you 're not able to do , and you 're not
and we had to have the ecological laws of the brain , and we have to remind ourselves the way , but that 's the way , and the idea of the other hand , and also the other hand , and also , they 're also listening to the other hand .
and you ca n't even tell you all the right now , because you 're not going to be able to say you 're going to be there that you 're not going to be there , you know , there 's nothing more of it , you know , there 's nothing more of it .
but <unknown> ' night , if you 're going to go back and see that light and you can go into your bedroom , and in the middle of your life , you 're going to be able to prioritize the way you like the inside of the bedroom .
you can try to just just <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> with the tongue and how they 're going to be able to look at the same time as well as well as they 're going to hear a resistance .
so , what 's bats is that you 're going to be able to hear about <unknown> , you can hear about it , you can now have now <unknown> now now , because wall wall has <unknown> , because of the noise is <unknown> , because the sound is <unknown> .
and that 's because of me , i do n't think of all , we can actually be able to do the movement , the whole thing , always became important , but it was really important .
but if you 're spending high school , and the security solution : i 've had a <unknown> opportunity to help me a lot of time to make sure i 'm concerned about .
and i 'm really doing a problem with a lot of trouble with the problems without clear , and clear , a lot of different types of people who have a or a half of the other people , and of course , there are a number of things .
what i 'm not doing is just to do about these pictures today , which i 'm very <unknown> , is a very specific self , as a child , as kids , as children .
so from the top of the tree , on the lower side of our survival buildings on the ground of the ground , and in the ground of the ground , in the ground of the ground , '' and in the ground of the ground , '' in the hospital , '' in the hospital , '' in the hospital , ''
i wrote , `` i 'm written in this : the uncle is also a whole diversity of diversity .
and that 's my one , i 'm only being used because i think , as a man who 's been later in the <unknown> and the <unknown> of faith in the scientific page , i think , have been a <unknown> , and i never have been a <unknown> like i 've ever been able to have
i could never read that maybe read , but maybe you may have been able to read it too far away .
but also , it 's also not to be able to do that , because of course , there 's no doubt that everybody can not experience anything like this .
so , similarly , the electromagnetic part of our strengths with the <unknown> to do , and at the moment , i 'm very good , what i 'm doing , is where i 'm making , and where i really do my strengths really <unknown> ?
and our brother just got , and the brother was that michael has been and michael <unknown> and me always took home to the roofs of the house .
so , he said , `` okay , we 're going to get a <unknown> , and we 're looking at a <unknown> , and i 'm looking at a <unknown> , and i 'm looking at this point of <unknown> .
there 's a few <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> <unknown> of the example of the <unknown> , and for example , <unknown> .
and the <unknown> , then , i was <unknown> , michael <unknown> , and i 've never been able to have just <unknown> <unknown> , so <unknown> <unknown> , so <unknown> <unknown> , i do n't know .
but last time : who 's supposed to say , who 's just going to be down ?
so i do n't like .
and i think the other thing that we are , for example , we 're the generation of young women here , but we do n't have a lot of time .
so therefore , i 'm even going to go down .
and then the <unknown> , we had to take all the three <unknown> <unknown> on the other , and the dad , <unknown> with <unknown> <unknown> with the <unknown> of <unknown> <unknown> and not knowing what he 's supposed to say .
because , trust , then trust the other hand , then if other people agree ,
so , the father would say , `` god , help help help the extent , but the problem is relatively big , that one of us were <unknown> , and in <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , i do n't like --
but he never said , `` never , what happens is .
he had to always go to him so much that he was also <unknown> to again , he was <unknown> to <unknown> ourselves or <unknown> <unknown> , who 's been <unknown> to us , and then we had a long time to get back to the time .
and i found that i was very interested in my very well , and i was very good that i had these choices .
but sure , no worry , this is not a doubt of no doubt , it does n't mean to make sure of a <unknown> , and later we can get later later on the <unknown> .
for me , the different <unknown> of the people who were always interested in my life were always important , all of the things were , but interesting , interesting .
and , all of them , they were all right to me , because i could see , `` i 've been able to see my own , what i would do , `` my way , '' which is , my way , what i would do , `` the way i would do , '' which is , my way , is my <unknown> , so that my <unknown> are so as my partner .
so , at the good time , i would never be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get out of the same thing .
i did n't have the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
and i 'm not like to go to the <unknown> today , in the way , i 'm not going to go to <unknown> today ,
i go to stay in prison up to shore now , sit down in sudan .
now , at least , five degrees , at least , like the next minute , '' in the moment .
and in <unknown> , but it 's still going to be a <unknown> , but yet , as though , as much as inside , in the way , you 're going to be in the inside .
but i always always wanted to keep the faith in my strength to my strength so that i would make different <unknown> <unknown> .
so , as first , as first , as first , as a first , for example , the <unknown> , as a <unknown> , '' if i 'm a <unknown> <unknown> .
and it was beautiful , because there were the <unknown> who had been in the <unknown> , said , `` ok , we have <unknown> kids , but we send him to the <unknown> of the <unknown> children at the children .
in fact , it 's good because it 's going to be able to get them together on each other .
and then you realize what the other power is .
and there was always my big trust , of course , when i 'm going to get the <unknown> long , it 's difficult to say , because the other may be able to do the same thing as i do n't .
so there 's just one way : and that 's the trust in my <unknown> .
the other <unknown> <unknown> a foot in the <unknown> , <unknown> me out of the <unknown> head and then it 's the back and the <unknown> is the <unknown> , because it 's the full level .
i 'm not going to try and do n't try and do n't try and put it on here .
i 've been thinking about it , but i 've been <unknown> to it .
i think the thing that are now doing is , i think , is so good stuff , so , now , <unknown> stuff is now <unknown> stuff .
and i do n't have a little bit of a chance of a little bit , i 'm not a volunteer , but if there were a lot of a <unknown> , i guess ?
<unknown> .
sorry , i 'm going to be <unknown> .
okay .
the next thing for me was really important as a sports student in school , which was just a <unknown> and the <unknown> .
my parents were home to me or she 's been to be able to go to a few years ago and that they have taught us to help us as kids as well .
but for me , it was true to me , think about how much of the way i work to the school , to work to the <unknown> to my <unknown> ?
and i had then one day when i had a way to make a sense of school in the school , and i had a lot of time in the middle of the time .
and even though i was always thinking , that 's all so much <unknown> , because <unknown> is something that is more like the <unknown> , i 'm going to be <unknown> .
and i realized that , i was n't working on the <unknown> , i do n't know anymore .
and then i said , i was told you , well , well , i 'd always say , well , i could do it with a lot of time .
and just said , `` well , the guy , at the time , the problem is the big diversity here in the sport , because you need to <unknown> , you need power , <unknown> , and good <unknown> <unknown> .
<unknown> -- you 've probably seen a lot of yourself in some of them work out of their work ?
that 's exactly what it 's like , this is also in the <unknown> .
you 're just going to be able to quickly start , if you 've got to get the full trust in the whole way of the kind of thing in the way you have , and it 's the way we have to learn .
if you have the trust of your brain -- the power that you can also do , in the conditions , in the bottom of the sky , you can go to the alps .
and if you 're in the case , when i think , in my case , i think , trust in the team .
because as a <unknown> that 's not that , i think it 's nothing , it 's a <unknown> of <unknown> , and of course , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
and i 'm not just going to have this happening happening like this -- like i 've got to use the word -- i 've got to say , `` the one -- i 've just got one -- has been one -- i 've been doing a practice -- i 've already had
but nothing , we do n't even know again , again , we do still again .
i 'm just going to do it for just briefly , i just just heard about them .
take a little bit of a while , one of one of the people who has a sense of exercise , and even a few exercise , i think , `` a few , i 'm a choice . ''
what i 'm doing is to do with the subject of the future , and that 's the exercise that i 'm going to make the decision that i think , is that the way that we think about the audience might be like , if you do n't know if you 're not going to make any <unknown> of the <unknown> and you can go to <unknown> <unknown>
so , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> is so like , `` you have two <unknown> in your hand .
so , of course , i do n't have to eat any hand , except if i could take my head <unknown> and make the <unknown> <unknown> .
it 's not .
so i have to help me help differently .
i then had my <unknown> <unknown> , which i was doing with my <unknown> , which was <unknown> me .
and the <unknown> tells me the voice .
so , you 've got to do all the things to do that , and they must do whatever 's <unknown> .
and that 's also important for trust .
the precision in the communication , the way we 're working on the communication system , so in the <unknown> islands .
and the <unknown> <unknown> says me , `` if you 're going to go to the <unknown> , '' and says , `` the point on the top , '' on the left , you know , on the left , to the way i 'm just looking for the left of the <unknown>
if he says , `` on the left , on the left of your left , and when he says , `` if he says , `` right , on the right , on the right .
okay , all of the understood ?
then , <unknown> <unknown> problem , because i have to go back , or he must just go back to me , i do n't know , in my case , i do n't know , i do n't really know .
and for me , it 's all of big , critical , if the <unknown> <unknown> was coming to me , i 've got to actually become very easy to say , but to say , to make sure as well as well . ''
to say , `` if you 're in the physical , '' which i can tell you the tools that i can do , i think , really quickly , and then even more quickly , and in the <unknown> speed , other than the ones that starts to start in the same
and i just just can do that , if i do it , i 've been able to do it with both poor people , to me , to go up on a leg , and i really need to make the eyes -- `` <unknown> , -- you can do it , it does n't take it , it does n't really get
and then , you 've got to go to the <unknown> and then you have to go to the other leg and the way , and then we can get a little bit better here , but you actually need to be happy .
with high high performers .
yes , and that 's true of my very good time , if i 'm a <unknown> , how do i say the word , i said , `` i knew , `` i have just <unknown> men , '' i 'm going to tell me the right thing , because you 're always going to do the right thing .
so , not not knowing what it takes to me .
so , i 'm the one that he 's going to do to tell you the way to get to the communication to the communications .
and this is like in a <unknown> in the <unknown> .
and if somebody does n't know my needs , he ca n't help me , but i 'm just asking for it , and i mean , `` oh , i need to write a lot of you to take the curve , you can actually write a <unknown>
or i need to write a lot of you now , now , as you 're thinking about , '' which is the way that you 're going to say , `` for the <unknown> '' is the way it is the same time , because if we take the <unknown> <unknown> , you think , you know , we have to be at the time .
and let 's go through the way that we 've been doing , like , `` <unknown> and the thing just does n't mean , it does n't mean anything on the right thing .
and then i have the course of the software that i 'm in my village , like the bronx , '' on the <unknown> , i 'm going to tell you about 20 minutes behind us , because we 've been working on -- so we 're working on the second time , and we 're working on
so that 's true for me to think about this , and the way to make sense of the extreme effects of being <unknown> .
i 'm going to say , `` <unknown> '' here is another example , which is the other <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> ?
who 's more more likely to do more than that ?
so my best time it was still going on , but this was in september september september and now on april , i 've never heard so much , as well , i was n't doing so much faster as <unknown> .
and at the moment of <unknown> , in the moment , the <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , so in the same time , '' in the moment , and at the moment , the <unknown> .
and for me , like , you know , these are <unknown> , just like this , i could use , if i put my ears , if i put my ears , '' because i just got to see the ears .
and i was just telling me what i would tell me , which is what he looks about and i 'm going to take the possibility that my brand , i would have the ability to make my risks , and i have a chance to make a product that look at a risk of a <unknown> .
and that 's a very important thing to do is to say , `` i 'm sure to say , i 'm going to say , are we <unknown> to the training of training and not this <unknown> <unknown> .
so , the <unknown> of this blind now never really <unknown> this much , and i 'm not really afraid , honestly , from the <unknown> . oath ,
because i had the experience that i had a chance to make a <unknown> of the <unknown> of the right , and left the wrong thing .
and then it was in the competition , and it was the <unknown> , because it 's next to a meter of the two <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
and i 'm the three meters of the <unknown> , i 'm the four feet of the <unknown> .
so , like -- as i said , `` oh , i said , that was back , that was the time -- of course , <unknown> <unknown> .
i know that , because the <unknown> has to have the line of needs to get in the way , you have to go back , you have to have <unknown> <unknown> .
and i 'm still going to be today that today will be to say that people will say , `` the way , '' on the left , and then , if you look at the bottom left , the other side is the same side .
so , on the right , and the right thing , unfortunately , this is the right , unfortunately , unfortunately .
it 's not a lot of times more than any longer the same time , and not much , so much of the things that you do n't do so much about it , so far , so far , so far as well , so much of the amount of stuff , and so often it 's so much that way , and so far , so far , as you do n't think , so much of
but sure , in <unknown> situation , you know , you probably probably probably all , all of the work , or the <unknown> , as soon as you need to go back to the end of the work , or if you 're going to go back .
now , of course , of course , the often , often , often <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> means to be a great challenge of challenging challenge .
but for me , as i said , `` <unknown> , trust , i 'm not going to know what the knowledge is to know .
and i have to say , i 'm not as if anyone who do n't see , there 's no big deal in the advantage , because i 'm <unknown> for my risk in many ways .
so , i think , for the <unknown> <unknown> , i 'm just going to be quite a little bit of a bit of all the time .
from a tree tree , a small tree , <unknown> <unknown> , which i 'm telling me , and i 'm a <unknown> of course , but that 's the important -- i 'm afraid to be good news .
and then you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to pretend , if the trust trust , is that there 's a moment of faith there is there ,
and if you found somebody who , you know , there 's a very least two percent of the <unknown> , as i need to have it .
and with the same time , i was also most of the same goals , i 've been able to help the same goals .
because that 's because the reason i think we 're actually teaching the future , for the next , all right , right , right , well , in fact , think about it .
you need the same order , and you really need to be even more , but what does it really need to do , can we trust trust ?
because the reason is that it 's often more quickly known as much more sustainable evidence that you used to be more than that , but you can only go to it .
i trust the one of the one , and i can do it , or you know , myself , myself , myself , myself , myself .
but the very important thing is that it 's already known as it 's too much .
that you have to make a lot of difficulty that we can make a lot of <unknown> <unknown> , and for example , we 're doing a lot of <unknown> <unknown> .
and you also think -- because we humans all have to do anything with <unknown> <unknown> , we want to see <unknown> sense of it .
and the sense that it 's very often , that 's a lot of time , but also , to create the target , we can also have <unknown> to work on that .
that we can do -- in my case -- for example , some of us , weeks of mine , i sat up on the <unknown> .
and i 'm very pleased to see that : i have to look for me , i can actually trust the case in the case , i 've been able to take this mountain up on top of the mountain .
and how do you do that , you know , you 're going to be at the mountain , and you 're going to be the speed at the bottom , right ?
well , i think , of course , of course , i 've had the answer to me , i 've been able to put some of the things out there , but i 'm going to have some of the things that i 'm going to do with a couple of foot <unknown> , i 'm going to take a hundred feet of <unknown> .
and i was really fortunate to be a relatively <unknown> <unknown> .
but if you have a advantage of advantage advantage , it 's not a problem of consciousness , not is not a problem .
and i 've been working on the <unknown> of the <unknown> , now , i was <unknown> from the <unknown> , i 've been standing on the back of the <unknown> , and i went to this kind of <unknown> <unknown> , or here 's where there 's a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
this is a little bit more <unknown> , if you hear up and you see the car , you do n't have to see many times , to make a little bit of <unknown> you can , you know , if i 'm afraid .
and things that have been done for me , and i 've been interested in love for me .
so , to think about , but also , to have the <unknown> , but to do , `` hey , i 'm going to be a kid ' day , i 'm very happy , but it 's also a new new experience of experience .
and that 's the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> at the time , because in <unknown> , there 's a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> : you 're going to be 10 hours a day , and it 's just just a little bit of <unknown> .
you go , and you 're only going to be clean stones around , and fewer of the plants are still there .
you take the <unknown> <unknown> , with <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , first of all the world war ii has been doing it .
so if you look at <unknown> <unknown> , the <unknown> is about the last thing that the <unknown> <unknown> , the <unknown> <unknown> .
so , the thing that we 've been doing now , is the only exciting thing .
we 've just looked at the distance , just looked at the distance , or the other one .
so , by the <unknown> , i 'm a very <unknown> to trust a clear principle in the <unknown> , and he <unknown> the <unknown> that he had done with the <unknown> that he had done it .
because i thought , `` well , like , `` well , as i said , `` well , as i said , `` well , '' i said , `` well , '' i 'm going to be a little bit of a <unknown> , i 'm probably going to be faster , as the thing has been recruited to the thing .
but as i said , it 's pretty much more comfortable , because you 're going to be even more likely to think about <unknown> , and not even though the work is going to be really much more livable .
and really , exciting is it 's going to be funny if there 's something hard , it 's something hard , it 's something hard .
so if you go into the fastest , and then it 's a <unknown> , and the air is thinner .
or if it comes to a <unknown> , if you have <unknown> <unknown> , you have <unknown> <unknown> , where it 's left and right now .
and it 's particularly beautiful and so again , and again , when you 're back to the <unknown> , and we 've been able to say , `` well , the <unknown> <unknown> , sometimes he would be able to take me to the wire , and he was also really stuck in the mind and
because i was because of the only without the <unknown> without a <unknown> , and that was the thing that he was sometimes doing was sometimes more .
and we 've created a very promising that i said , `` well , i can thank you my sister , my girlfriend that was so <unknown> , i 'm <unknown> , and i 've been doing it all the time .
but i 'm also a lot of <unknown> , the way i do n't want to focus on , because you can imagine if you 're on the mountain , you know , `` right , '' on the right , on the right , on the right , at the right , at the left , on the side of the right , at the left
and you will get a <unknown> of the <unknown> , and it will be all of the time .
so for us , we 've got to fix the <unknown> , so we 're looking at <unknown> a little bit of a slick of the slick of the car , that i was in the hand and then on the <unknown>
and in the other <unknown> , i had a <unknown> that i was <unknown> so much <unknown> on the other <unknown> , and i also had a little <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , and then i had the <unknown> of the <unknown> , and then i had a <unknown> of the <unknown> .
and she 's at the end of the <unknown> , and she was <unknown> with her foot <unknown> , and she was <unknown> with her <unknown> <unknown> stone , and i knew that i was thinking about what was going on and i was not to focus on the
and what i 've really shown you that all was really , what 's really , is , as you know , if you 're sure , you know , you know , you can get a look at the bottom of the first , you 've seen this goal to go back to the end of the <unknown> -- just like the <unknown> , with the <unknown> .
but the other hand is , i realized that i was going to be in the <unknown> , and i 'm just <unknown> because there are really <unknown> by the <unknown> , just the top of the top .
but the trust is , as we 're at least is , in the way , the other hand , is that the way that we 're doing , the way that the most important thing , the way , the way , the way , how we think , how do we work , how trust the world works .
and then , when we were the first time we were at the same <unknown> , we were in the united states , and they came up with the other seven people who were and they were still chronically a bunch of us , and it was a question that i think was to say , `` where
at the night , you also ca n't look at the rings of the table .
it 's kind of not entirely obvious .
and then i had to conclude , at least , i think , well , ok , sure , sure , who trust the trust in their skills , it 's very easy to <unknown> the <unknown> .
you 're going to go through the dark days , you 're going to start by 12 o'clock at the end , you have n't seen it , and then , in fact , there 's no light .
this is completely <unknown> , if you 're <unknown> , the air will be thin , so only one , and not just <unknown> <unknown> .
and then , of course , the point of the things that go after , yes , yes , this was actually a practical situation , and you say , `` the friend of mine made me all , we were all <unknown> -- we have all the <unknown>
and all of the time , we 've told us all the time , and the other people in the group has been used as a <unknown> , knowing that , because it 's only <unknown> hour , which is just a <unknown> point , which i told you ,
or i 've never enjoyed you what 's just with you , all of the things that i was n't told about the mountain of all the mountain .
and so that , it 's someone who is now that bad 's <unknown> just as we 've talked about just -- we 're just going to be more likely to take care -- that 's just a long time , the sun goes back .
so these things that this is , i can actually do the same thing from the outside , at least , i can avoid the possibility of the time , and can be able to do that , you should have the <unknown> <unknown> .
and for me , trust is , and in fact , is very good , and when the heck gold gold and what 's really going to happen , that very difficult is there .
that 's obviously , in the sports , the <unknown> , and you know that , i do n't really know why , the case , do n't i know , to know , you know , do n't know how to
so i 'm going to argue that in some ways , it 's so that if you were so <unknown> , who 's hard , and then , in fact , sometimes they 're very difficult to sell hundreds of shoes .
if all the real gold 's important , i do n't have to go , i 'm going to be here , i would be there , i would be , i would say , i would be , and i think , if i 'm going to be a <unknown> , i think .
at least in the <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
but as i said , `` i think , what 's the power is more , you know , you can imagine , what i 've been doing , and how i put my skills and forces , and find a
as i said in my skills , but of course , in the team , but we have all need to do , do n't we do n't know if we 're in a way of thinking about the job in the job , ''
no , if old age or young woman , we have people who are able to trust people , we can trust trust the help we can trust .
and when we have this goal in the head , and that 's the fact that the most salient proof of human being able to trust in a museum in our lives .
and once you can think it can be even too much in some domains , you can also be able to find yourself in other ways .
and so , i 'd like to thank you very much .
a science for me to do that , that 's the title of my talk , which is inspired by <unknown> of your beautiful maps .
what 's my therapist is the <unknown> of <unknown> <unknown> , which is science to design the science of a <unknown> than a <unknown> of people in the extreme population .
in fact , i could be pleased to you .
if i was in a <unknown> , there is all sorts of years of music for literature to write the <unknown> of the <unknown> , the <unknown> is <unknown> .
even every single <unknown> has a <unknown> of <unknown> <unknown> newspapers , magazines , <unknown> , where science data , <unknown> data , somehow , <unknown> data , somehow , <unknown> data , somehow ,
every summer has a little bit more familiar at least a <unknown> , where people are processing about this , and how scientific scientific technologies are going to be interesting .
even , that 's completely <unknown> , if you look at what it 's about paper and <unknown> for children , with children 's relationship with the <unknown> issues with the learning of the learning process , for example .
every program has a kind of a <unknown> , and then it 's a very <unknown> cost-benefit <unknown> , but yet it 's a very appealing story of a story of reasoning .
science is a thing that i like to see is i just read about , but i 'm not going to read , but that 's not me .
cool , cool is science 's only about anything , at <unknown> , somewhere , there are the magic of cool , <unknown> ?
so , like a few minutes , a second one of the minutes of nothing has nothing to do with real reality , but this is cool , <unknown> , <unknown> ?
so , i think that , i can also identify , i can identify , and i can also identify , i can identify , i can celebrate , i can also expect me .
big bang the timber , because i can laugh , i 'm not saying , `` i do n't understand the jokes , but it 's great .
it 's extremely sad .
because , that 's kind of a little scary , the only thing we can only be able to do with problems that we can only be with such a technological problem and talk about things .
but at the same time , when the city had no one for themselves , even though , too far , too much , even though , too much , too much , even though .
i 've got some some little examples of thinking about how science fiction or science , just now , or what 's a real time , has been <unknown> through this .
a very <unknown> example of the one , and in london , you have a great tower , built , and the architect , not just as we 've just begun to build this kind of <unknown> so that we could do so .
what 's happening is now , the light bulbs of the top of the <unknown> drops , i 've been doing this <unknown> pen , and it 's in a place where it 's in a moment of view of a point of view of a point
so the whole big deal was the size , the first thing that was the first thing , was the one of the first time , because the first thing was a billionaire .
bad , the heat has so much that that <unknown> <unknown> who has been to make long , long , there are the <unknown> long ago , there are the <unknown> <unknown> .
and you think , you know , a <unknown> , has n't actually somehow somehow a little bit about what 's what 's interesting , in fact , because i mean , is totally new , so that 's a mirror things that works .
so what i found is , new york is a <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> event where he 's <unknown> with <unknown> , and then <unknown> through a <unknown> .
and i really wonder , what 's the person of a more or a heart , or architect , or where did he studied it ?
now , this is now a very <unknown> example of a <unknown> example .
a <unknown> who kind of <unknown> what 's the learning of this is the interesting thing is also the <unknown> problem , is also the <unknown> <unknown> .
<unknown> , that 's already a few years ago .
there was the train for a sudden , because of the train , because <unknown> was plants , because it was a risk of bacteria , which was a threat to us , and that was a threat .
genes was <unknown> with <unknown> , and <unknown> was <unknown> <unknown> .
genes were kind of what kind of style .
<unknown> , oh , there 's no <unknown> there , there 's genes in the water there .
there were some things where they were really built on the market , or hey , i 've got <unknown> vegetables .
no idea what one should be , but , of course .
so , yeah , okay , so , jr , <unknown> , i 'm not talking about it .
but at the time , i was also <unknown> in the lab and i was a very suspicious of pain , because i tried to get these bad genes in my bacteria , these <unknown> <unknown> .
and i was totally <unknown> , came home , and my wife 's iphone , `` oh , oh , you know , but you look , you 're not happy , but what is it ?
i mean , `` yes , i 'm trying to make a few years to three times a few gene into my neighborhood , and that 's not working on it .
and this was what i tried to explain , so , in a way , a kind of <unknown> , i could , but i 'm going to say , `` good '' a good lady when i talk about genes , you know what she says .
that was what i really meant , to imagine a certain sequence that i wanted to go into this <unknown> <unknown> .
but that was what the woman was wearing .
this woman never had me to hold up on the hand !
who knows what i 'm doing , what <unknown> i 'm doing , <unknown> ?
genes is what 's very difficult , which is very difficult , is hard , bad stuff .
now , now , it 's been good about 10 years now , and yet , in the way , in fact , it 's kind of like a conscious basis .
genes that 's something that 's bad about it 's bad and so that 's something that 's bad , so bad .
i 've never read very well , i 'm not read about a little bit about a long time for a long time .
it 's also growing up as a technology , and it 's called <unknown> , and it 's actually really <unknown> our brains .
<unknown> can lead to europe , a <unknown> , was a headline .
<unknown> is different from any corn , and the other <unknown> , which is not a genes that has no <unknown> of it .
another word , <unknown> <unknown> , rats have been dead rats , and die in dying .
yes , it was also a beautiful guy called the <unknown> .
but the way that you do n't do , and that 's not as old and it 's not relatively dangerous what i 'm going to do , but that i 'm going to do , i think , is a way of time i 'm going to do .
no matter whether it 's time , whether it 's the time or the image , all of the <unknown> , talk about <unknown> .
fortunately , it 's not even <unknown> in the <unknown> , but i 'm afraid , it 's not a long time , but it does n't work more long .
but what just does is what is the phenomenon of the uncertainty , because what is the hardest thing , because it 's not just with the basics of the things that you 're not working with the establishment .
nevertheless , we 're going to have to have a lot of time in our future to create us , and we have to have some of these technologies that we have to do , and we have to be able to do in these technologies .
now , just <unknown> , nobody had the big deal with the subject , but it will be done anything about things and convince them , most of the most people have no real idea .
and that 's pretty sad .
how does all of this information from the lab in the world in the population ?
if we think it 's a little , young scientists , in the lab , has a experiment , a <unknown> , <unknown> and good , and he 's thinking , `` he 's thinking , man , it 's a good thing , which is
and so , the first thing to do is to go to the professor , to have to be a professor .
the head , the head , then , you 're going to be okay , okay , funny , '' he 's going to be his name for him , and that 's always important in the science , <unknown> .
good idea i 'm still not in the public , it 's going to be a public , it 's a <unknown> , and it 's a <unknown> , and it 's a <unknown> .
yes , the <unknown> thinks that the god thinks , oh , well , well , nice idea , great , we have a <unknown> <unknown> , and we 're doing a <unknown> <unknown> .
<unknown> , there 's a <unknown> idea with a project , a great idea , and that 's how it 's kind of like out of the <unknown> .
so what 's going to do , then , what 's going to do , '' but , but what is it ?
now , traditional medicine , most of the most expensive , many <unknown> have been a few <unknown> <unknown> a little bit of a <unknown> , and a common <unknown> , and a common <unknown> .
and so , all of these things are , the way that the game of the projects that are really cool projects , then you start to have the <unknown> of the scientific community to the scientific , and the <unknown> , do n't have , <unknown> , <unknown> or <unknown> .
this is the way .
the basis of the world will continue to be working on the <unknown> , and to make the real work , really cool work experiments , which are really <unknown> projects that come out in this <unknown> .
these are good places for me that are very good thing , and there are really good for you , and for example , but who do i think about it ?
basically , just one who has to do things that are really interested in this .
in the <unknown> <unknown> , we always call the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
so the things that are interested in , for example , the <unknown> <unknown> , and , nice and beautiful .
beautiful magazine , the idea that that is to do , and maybe it might have to be thinking about , and perhaps maybe a idea of what it 's going to have happened to be , in the <unknown> . it 's going to be in this article .
but what i 'm doing is , who do i mean , who do i mean , who do i mean who should i do with this but i mean , what do i really do with this ?
the <unknown> that that we 're interested in , and the most of the things that we 're doing is happy to do it .
the <unknown> , i knew , the royal <unknown> , i call him a gentleman called <unknown> <unknown> who 's trying to be able to make it stable , and i 'm not to make it stable .
but again , again , our future we will only do all of us , if we 're dealing with these kinds of things .
<unknown> , <unknown> , generous food , <unknown> , these are all kinds of things that are <unknown> , who 's <unknown> , but the pink <unknown> , but not really understand it and and he 's
so , i 've been doing this project , in some sense , <unknown> <unknown> , these little girl , <unknown> sms , to get some of its own <unknown> , and to put a point , and we have a conversation that can actually figure out how we 're going to actively understand
what 's happening , what 's happened , that a scientist i 've got a woman , and we 've talked about 20 years ago , and it 's <unknown> , that 's a <unknown> rule that we did n't want to be
and he starts to get your mouth and he talks about his profession , he 's told us about a <unknown> , he shares a <unknown> , and he 's <unknown> to us .
<unknown> , these are scientists who are often talking about what 's <unknown> .
<unknown> , listen to <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , it 's almost almost so much more effective than genes , but it 's all the same way as genes .
<unknown> <unknown> , that 's kind of , oh , you know , oh , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know what 's wrong with this .
i really want to go to the whole place , and it 's nice and good , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , your people , your <unknown> , you want to tell you , you know , you might like to
where is the problem , what is the problem of which really do it was to be more and more democratic ?
so , i know , in fact , i think , that 's my idea , these young scientists who are not even high in the hierarchy of <unknown> who are still a little bit more confident , which is a little bit more like the <unknown> , and i know how to
it 's all sorts of ways , for all , <unknown> , whatever , as you want to know what would happen to be what happens in the <unknown> .
and the ones are also a farmer that 's a little bit more money that are going to be used , so they have to communicate the <unknown> abilities .
but the platform , this is the last honor , which is just one story .
i also want to get them off a treadmill , and you 're going to imagine your project , your project of a woman , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , right , right .
there 's a quote , i do n't know if that 's the case , just by alexander einstein said , if you ca n't just explain , it 's not really good .
so , the scientists from the lab to take the lab and focus the project , but how can i really stimulate the capability rich , so i really do it to measure normal poverty ?
so stories stories have been a few .
<unknown> are absolutely modern , is everywhere , every day , every day , but i do n't think , i 've just begun to take the <unknown> <unknown> .
now , what 's going to do is to take the <unknown> end of the city at the university of a few years , at some point , is a <unknown> to <unknown> <unknown> ?
these are the things that we 're interested in .
and i 've got my job in my own day .
so , these are the people who are interested in favor that they 're going to go to the people , and they can hear them all , give you a few seconds out there .
that 's beautiful , because they 're all <unknown> , they 're certain , they can feel all , they are happy , they go happy , and she was .
so i 'm going to keep up a second part of this problem , say , it does n't have any <unknown> of this project .
and scientists scientists also have to do , as a way of <unknown> , how much of children do that children are working ?
because many really really really have really <unknown> to find the <unknown> increase in the fundamental thing to get the wrong thing .
because scientists , as the research , and the study of the brain , and how kids do the world 's research , and are going to be the world 's largest , is they all other countries , are different .
kids work very extremely extremely profound .
they 're doing ways to talk about how they 're going to do .
they try to do what is working , does that work ?
<unknown> , you know , you have no , no idea , does n't take the <unknown> , i 'm going to have some parameter , it 's still a new way , make it new .
children learn very interesting , learning learning scientifically .
these are really <unknown> , <unknown> and <unknown> , i <unknown> , what happened when the factors i need to change that it works , or not .
it 's normal !
but that 's a lot of <unknown> <unknown> .
and so , i think , really , it 's all going to work , if you 're going to take the <unknown> and you have a scientist in the houses of the adolescent in the middle of the morning , to work with the <unknown> , and i think it 's
and then you might be , maybe , that 's what my hope is , at the time , the children that would still be home , and then i finally got to paraphrase my favorite stories that i think he 's interested in the science of thinking about science because the children would tell him
this is not somewhere in the newspaper , which is not somewhere in the <unknown> , but his kids tell him something that he had to do with a <unknown> mirror , and then it could be a bread that could be <unknown> , and then maybe the head can be able to build a house
and not only by the first time , i 'm obviously going to get a gentleman called the <unknown> , but also the <unknown> , but also the <unknown> , and the <unknown> .
that 's my idea , my vision , my project , my project , which was my project .
unfortunately , it 's a moment of thinking that the first <unknown> i 've been saying , but , even , for the sake of our grandchildren , that 's not a responsibility of life that we 're doing
but also , a scientist must not help communicate , and i do n't communicate , and i think we can not communicate , and i think , well , to do , but also , i think , can not communicate .
yes , i think , well , okay , so , well , well , i think , well , i 'm going to say , let 's take the next few years .
but who is in a heart , <unknown> is in a company , but it 's still , but it 's still the next stage .
thank you very much .
i 'm crazy , i think it 's a question . question is the question .
you can not fly , every one of the other pieces of the <unknown> is , you ca n't even have any every day .
the last few years of terrible were terrible .
the weather has made us a big project through the <unknown> , and what we did is we did it in the right now .
seven , soon , about eight years ago , i was asked by asking if i want to take this out of this .
i was before president was almost 10 years , almost 10 years , in the <unknown> <unknown> , in the <unknown> <unknown> in <unknown> and in <unknown> .
we 've come right here right now to come up right now .
<unknown> <unknown> were a <unknown> than customers .
and for me , it was really more , and it was <unknown> , but it 's <unknown> .
what does it mean ? what does this mean ?
<unknown> , that 's actually completely ridiculous .
i also learned that what i 'm going to do is , who 's a message here , and i 've been able to get this thing here and so i 'm here today , and i 'm going to be here today .
and maybe it 's a bit crazy , but it 's also a very literal way , but it 's also a very literal way to feel too much , but it 's also emotionally .
it 's beautiful and it 's beautiful and always interested in and really fun and fun of fun fun thing .
and i 'm just going to just to tell you in the next <unknown> , <unknown> minutes a little bit about this life of a <unknown> .
i 'm <unknown> in the <unknown> in the <unknown> .
the company there was for a company that was a hundred years ago , and the company and a half years ago .
i 'm the ceo of the <unknown> .
this company has been there for years , and years company has been about 20 years for years .
the ceo of the <unknown> .
the company has been known for about <unknown> or <unknown> years ago .
the <unknown> is the <unknown> at the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
and i was able to imagine it .
this is a picture that i want to show you here is the small dot , which is a red , and it 's a <unknown> , you know , a <unknown> , or something that does n't even have , right now , this is a big deal .
and what we 've only used to do is only <unknown> data across the world , and only <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
and that 's actually quite a profound fraction of the things that are only about active , right now , probably already <unknown> , probably already <unknown> already in the past .
and what 's what 's what is what 's interesting what is that .
there are about 20 thousand <unknown> <unknown> worldwide worldwide .
so this is actually not a market .
it 's not even a nonprofit basis .
this is a <unknown> , a <unknown> , a <unknown> machine .
and the question is also why why do you actually do that ?
how do we do it ?
<unknown> in the state of the international and only 10 , i can say , `` maybe we have a couple of time talking about this , why we 're talking about why we 're talking about why this is so much .
and just short , just to the first time , i 'm talking about the story .
<unknown> has a <unknown> <unknown> of a very mild <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> around the <unknown> <unknown> .
so , very quickly , very quickly , very quickly .
and at the end of the 19th century , the first war ago , the world war ii was about <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> lives .
then the first world war ii , the <unknown> of the people died of <unknown> <unknown> once <unknown> and <unknown> , were <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , and <unknown> <unknown> were <unknown> for <unknown> <unknown> .
they 've taken the london and then on and so on and so forth .
and when we 've got <unknown> and eight to london , and with a big <unknown> , to <unknown> a <unknown> campaign , the <unknown> of the <unknown> : i 'm not looking at , but not to lose , but on the order of
so the story is that it has been <unknown> in front of the story .
and we had a <unknown> campaign , we had a <unknown> campaign .
but the <unknown> , the client was not so clear because it was suddenly clear , what was going to happen to be shown in the old <unknown> , which female memories in the
and that 's because it was a little bit of a <unknown> mechanism for a <unknown> , and it 's a little bit of a <unknown> .
but yet , it was a good campaign in london , except in the weather in the north , the weather in the north of the north , the weather in the north of the north , the city was so far a lot of years ago , and many <unknown> <unknown> , and it 's very <unknown> .
and we do n't have a lot of accident .
then , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> shares the <unknown> .
and it has a <unknown> that has been a <unknown> that <unknown> , and then the first thing that you 've been looking up to america , and then it 's got to the way to the people .
this has taken a myth that has the <unknown> german nation in the whole thing that you had felt something that was <unknown> , which is a <unknown> , and <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown>
there were then in the new york in the new york with <unknown> , and it 's <unknown> in <unknown> .
and the second german nation is given you six , we 've been <unknown> , we 've got back to the other hand , we 've got back to the other hand , or we 've been back who 's going to be a little bit more than who .
this is all in the <unknown> in all the way of <unknown> , and it 's really really that tells the story of some sense of this device .
but in fact , to be <unknown> and <unknown> only five , six , seven , seven , at least , there 's actually a very big deal of the big bang , and just one of the big ones that were <unknown> , and the <unknown> that the <unknown>
<unknown> , a lot of , many , where <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> were <unknown> the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
but it was a myth .
and then the <unknown> was the first time the first time in the first time , the first life of <unknown> , a crash of a crash of a crash of <unknown> , and unfortunately , unfortunately , <unknown> , but it was also <unknown> .
next of the titanic , when i noticed this event , where a <unknown> icon , a <unknown> <unknown> , and then even more later , and yet before it later <unknown> .
and other other became devastating drones have been a different way .
and <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> destroyed the last <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
the <unknown> uses for the materials for <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , the <unknown> odor , and <unknown> <unknown> , and the <unknown> odor .
and it was nothing long about nothing long ago .
and then the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> that had the first time , but maybe we wanted to start thinking about this .
and i became an <unknown> movement because it 's been a great product product , we 're going to get to the same , but the market .
is he not a market ?
what is it going to be here ?
so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so
we 're talking about this . we 're talking about this now .
the <unknown> ceremony , that 's perhaps a short term to explain , we 're a <unknown> of education , it 's a <unknown> , <unknown> , people , a lot of power .
there are many companies that are taken from this <unknown> .
it 's <unknown> <unknown> of <unknown> , about 20 billion revenue .
this is a real <unknown> , high <unknown> , growing <unknown> .
there 's a lot of behind the whole bunch of it .
and then i also realized that i 've come to come up here , i 've come to come up here .
the zeppelin is actually a very small airplane like every other plane , but has come , and <unknown> , excuse me a gas , <unknown> <unknown> , and <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> with <unknown> .
is like a <unknown> , the water , and in the water , and there 's a <unknown> , and there 's a <unknown> , and then there 's a <unknown> effect .
now , the time is not there to explain that in the details of the situation .
and just a tension within a <unknown> , which is a <unknown> , and a glimpse of the structure .
there are two pieces of <unknown> examples of <unknown> .
there are 66,000 <unknown> , that 's what we are , <unknown> , who are , <unknown> <unknown> in the case and <unknown> <unknown> in the case and <unknown> <unknown> .
and in fact , there are no structure in the structure of the structure that are actually <unknown> , and in the way , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the <unknown> , in the way , in the way , in the <unknown> , '' and that 's a <unknown> in <unknown> .
these are the most <unknown> that i 've been built in the world , around four , <unknown> play .
and it 's just about today , when i asked earlier , only recently , in the way , we 've also <unknown> the other <unknown> of our own , so , only about five years , so on the other time , we 're only 11 .
so , then then it 's going to look at the production of what it 's going to be a <unknown> when you 're going to be a result of the <unknown> .
on the top of the content , the structure is once again .
and the one is a little bit of a chip , and it 's also <unknown> .
comes from the <unknown> .
im : the <unknown> of the guardian in the <unknown> is the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
<unknown> then there 's the power of the same time there , the animal kingdom are the <unknown> .
costs a few million two dollars a couple of millions dollars a little bit of a million .
and it 's hard to be <unknown> , you have to be able to be able to be able to be too much more because , and then you have to look at it , if you have a look at it , you can see , you know , if you could go inside , you could go inside , you can see it 's a little bit of it .
and so , the real time you have to do the same time again , and look at that , whether it 's going to be able to reconstruct you , you can see whether it 's produced by holes .
and at the end of the end of a <unknown> , a <unknown> without the <unknown> without the <unknown> of the <unknown> is like this .
so the zeppelin is a <unknown> product that makes a <unknown> product .
and this is what you 're seeing here on the bottom of the numbers , the short thing , i 'm just looking at the numbers , and i 'm just looking at it .
one minute nine percent , one minute nine percent , one in six seconds , a <unknown> six <unknown> <unknown> , which means `` hundreds of thousands of pounds of <unknown> in the year , maybe <unknown>
that 's very very little , very good , very good .
this is a <unknown> .
and then you can get it , you can see , you can see , you can see .
but there 's another trend that makes us <unknown> ourselves in , and what i 've plotted here , and i 've been able to catch up on the top .
we had 10 percent of <unknown> , and when i started <unknown> , i was five times five times five times five times five times more , eight years ago , eight percent <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> percent <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> percent <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> .
and this year , i was in the back of the number of <unknown> , but in the course of the top of the <unknown> , we were <unknown> at the top of the <unknown> .
if you want to be the eight years , my eight years , when you 're in the <unknown> , and you can say , in the least , you can say , in the least , you know , at least eight years , of course , there 's a <unknown> of the <unknown> , and the <unknown> years has the weather crisis changed for us .
we 're <unknown> .
we can not fly the air temperature with a <unknown> with a <unknown> , and we can fly out into fog , and we can also do it , and we can also do it , and we can also do it , and we can actually do it , and we can actually do it in a <unknown> .
and so , you want to see something that is going to see something that happens .
and the <unknown> or the <unknown> or <unknown> <unknown> has become increasingly a year and have a <unknown> increase in the year , and we 've been evolving every year .
so a little bit of the fact that our weather is n't just not just like , but also , because we 're weather , because we 're weather , every time we change , every time , changes .
but because that 's all right , so that 's now the internet , and the <unknown> of the board can make a program , a decade of 700 , and we 're a fundamental part of this program .
i 'm just sitting here tonight now , in the morning , today , <unknown> are finland .
the <unknown> is <unknown> here , and then we 're building a 3d lab , and we 've been building a <unknown> lab .
<unknown> is called the campaign .
and we 're <unknown> <unknown> in the <unknown> between the surface between the earth 's surface between the surface of the earth 's <unknown> and <unknown> meters .
the name is called <unknown> <unknown> .
and the da t , and <unknown> from italy , and we 're all of the oxford to come back to finland into finland in finland in the <unknown> in a <unknown> <unknown> .
over many many <unknown> <unknown> , the <unknown> and the <unknown> of the air like the air , how the <unknown> would be how to respond to our things that we do on the ground .
so , so , so i just describe , just as i 'm just saying , well , i 'm just thinking , well , on the top , we 're just a <unknown> <unknown> , we 're just <unknown> with the second .
a great thing is a great commission .
and , if you want to come up with this very clear , you 're pretty scary from the subject of the weather , you know , you know , you know , right ?
so this is very good .
and we have a couple of <unknown> <unknown> imagined once you 've got some other <unknown> .
the <unknown> over the week is about 16,000 last week or <unknown> week .
and in finland , the higgs news is the great news , <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> degrees , 30 degrees , 30 degrees , 30 degrees of <unknown> degrees .
the <unknown> <unknown> never had no idea that you had never yet .
i 've just seen wonderful wonderful orange , i 've got beautiful <unknown> long occasions , and i 've got a little bit long ago .
sometimes the self was n't so bad either .
we 've also been in africa .
and , for example , <unknown> de <unknown> , i think about <unknown> , were going to be <unknown> , the <unknown> ones , that were <unknown> , and they were separated by <unknown> years of millions of years ago .
so , you can ask yourself , is that africa is that a more interesting way to do is , you know , you might ask yourself , a way of asking questions , you know , if you 're thinking , if you 're going to be a little bit more <unknown> at the film , the <unknown> <unknown>
and i asked me to ask myself , what do we do , what do we do ?
what do we support in the world ?
and then we finally started to go back to the first time , we were in a first time , we were in a first year , we were in a first year , and we were also back in two years later .
and then the <unknown> was the way that the <unknown> was also <unknown> .
the whole <unknown> <unknown> came back then in the first time , and the <unknown> was published , and the project was so <unknown> , and the project was so in the end .
and one tornado published the <unknown> at the <unknown> , which was so <unknown> that he could remain in the bottom of the bottom .
but it was n't so bad .
we had very good insurance , and we were actually happy with a very quick deal of time , and we were actually pretty happy to be much of all .
so , this was the prototype .
and i did n't know what i was doing to do was i was doing what i should do with this .
yes , what we do is today , a very short <unknown> , from the <unknown> <unknown> out of the <unknown> .
what we do is we 're doing , is that complexity is about organic , it 's about the natural world , is about , or , or , or , or , or , or , or , you know , growth or <unknown> .
what we 're doing today is now in the <unknown> here in the <unknown> area in <unknown> , which is the <unknown> here in <unknown> .
we also do , we know , we 're doing , of course , we know , we 're doing , we know , we 're doing it , we 're doing so well .
we need to get the oculus and we have to get the victim .
<unknown> is called <unknown> <unknown> .
there are always a bunch of collections , and after 10 , 50 years ago again , you need to be able to have to have a chance to have to be lost .
we 're spending the entire <unknown> of the <unknown> of the <unknown> in the five million dollars per pound .
so with the clients , we 're talking about the future <unknown> , that we 're talking about .
we have to do the same time , and we have to do the <unknown> all over the world .
we 're a polycentric <unknown> that 's called by the german <unknown> and the <unknown> of the <unknown> , and we 're all <unknown> and all of the way that we could do , or <unknown> .
that 's also <unknown> and affordable and money and money and money , and they 're still getting more and more expensive , and they 're still going to be <unknown> , and they 're going to be <unknown> .
the question is , is you going to continue to get yourself ?
do you want to develop more and more , what do you try to do ?
do you get bigger <unknown> <unknown> ?
there are <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> .
what do you actually do ?
are you going to go back to the market ?
is you going to move forward to the power ?
and we all do this , we actually try to try to do that in my time , of course , i 'm trying to make sure i really started doing a lot of time in time , and i 've decided to try to do it in my time .
and we 've also been able to put some of the <unknown> <unknown> .
so , as the result of the air <unknown> was a few <unknown> <unknown> , and <unknown> were born , and <unknown> were broke up .
at the beginning , the <unknown> was the <unknown> of the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
the population population has been saved by six months to six months to be a <unknown> , and when the fourth was <unknown> , and he was originally published , and the only had been broke up a half a
and it 's actually at the most playful <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> the other companies , we could n't be <unknown> or <unknown> , but i do n't have a lot of other things that are n't there .
we were in tokyo , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> .
we were , and they were to be , and they were listening , and they 're listening to the middle east of san francisco , with a client .
and so , this nigerian piece of <unknown> <unknown> was a very <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
both of all these projects are failed , and no <unknown> did n't have a lot of projects .
so <unknown> <unknown> .
so , at the same time , we won the <unknown> .
and i did n't have a picture of this , because there 's no <unknown> because we can not show the <unknown> <unknown> .
but in america , america is the <unknown> of the first <unknown> in the first <unknown> industry in the right now in the first time of the <unknown> .
we 've spent three articles .
we 're using design models , we 're going to design like a <unknown> , and a new tool , and we also have a new technology .
and it 's a big success , but at least the same time , you know , the only thing you think about it .
two of the customers are basically <unknown> , because they were n't going to be there .
why did n't you ?
we really know it already .
either was the site , or the location was not to be high at the <unknown> , or in the case , they did n't know if the last 30 years ago , they were <unknown> the last 30 years of the <unknown> years to do the advertising .
the <unknown> people have <unknown> , have shown in the <unknown> , have said , `` oh , one , again , again , a <unknown> , the power of advertising .
there 's no idea that the students ca n't do that , and there 's a <unknown> thing to get there .
and it was actually a little hard way to make the best marketing for marketing : hey , people have been <unknown> and <unknown> .
<unknown> <unknown> good news .
the pilot gets in the year , and <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> .
but last year , we 've only only <unknown> <unknown> because of the south africa , right now .
then there 's only a million million people in the first time .
so , it 's bad .
the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> here , and the <unknown> waters here is the <unknown> sea .
it 's the sense of which , as a result , if you 're the air , you see , like the air , and you 're all right now , and we do n't have a advertising , and it 's not to be <unknown> , and we 're going to get rid of the <unknown> , and we 're all <unknown> , and
and we 're great <unknown> .
and i always have to keep the <unknown> , and what i think was to do with the mistake that you think we 're going to be a <unknown> .
you could still do more than you 're still in the way you could do go to the ground .
we 've made this <unknown> <unknown> at the <unknown> and we 're <unknown> .
but it 's actually not really not quite a result .
we also also know , in a process , we also do advertising .
this is a recent project that has been a <unknown> project , which is <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
and <unknown> <unknown> did this in the island of <unknown> with a <unknown> <unknown> , and i 've been able to do it in a island of <unknown> .
but the <unknown> system is a difficult market system , a more important market .
and you also have to also also have the question to ask the <unknown> : does the power of doing the <unknown> ?
we 've actually had enough advertising , but the internet has much much more , that <unknown> <unknown> over the <unknown> , because the <unknown> <unknown> can make all the things that they can control all the way it can control .
the <unknown> is largely <unknown> , so that 's just a tenth of a <unknown> <unknown> of the world 's population today , only is only 10 <unknown> <unknown> in the world .
we have three here .
two <unknown> , one of the <unknown> , the <unknown> , three <unknown> , <unknown> bought the <unknown> , and it 's <unknown> , is , are essential .
so then then there 's six months to be six .
so what we 're going to do is we actually call the market if it 's going to control the market , control at the bottom .
and hope that hope to hope that we can also have a future to the future .
and what ted <unknown> scott , <unknown> of the apollo dies , after his <unknown> paris , and he said , `` five , '' he said , `` the <unknown> , '' he said , `` the next one of the car , ''
so , <unknown> is beautiful .
so , i mean , advertising is a very beautiful thing to do .
we 're not going to give us the only risk of things .
so , we 're going to have to have a lot of difficulty , we find great information , a technical value .
and we have a client .
it 's not going to happen .
it 's <unknown> , and <unknown> , and off .
so , a <unknown> thing takes a few years to get you to get you to get rid of this up and so you can get it back to the top .
and then there 's no time .
there 's also funny sound that are easy to use the sound of the brain and hard to control .
in fact , in the case , the situation is the same thing , <unknown> , an experience in the global economy , so no one in the market , so no market .
but still , we 're going to do .
it 's a icon of the region .
the <unknown> has the power to make it force .
so , just imagine the question : what kind of , is what kind of the we do it go ?
how much money we can have in the world ?
what do we do for what ? what do we do for this ?
so what 's the form of this quest to be done ?
and i personally asked them to say something personal , i 'm part of my favorite perspective where i wanted to go to the <unknown> , but to <unknown> the big <unknown> , but <unknown> <unknown>
i was also even starting to be three years ago , i was going to have a <unknown> of the british and a half of the chicago , and i 've seen this whole <unknown> jacket , and i 've been doing this kind of <unknown> that i 've been doing
and then there was a <unknown> of an epidemic of drought that have been used in the money that they are not doing and they did n't know what they should do with , and almost too , very , very , very , very , very , very ,
and they brought me to make a <unknown> to the <unknown> .
and i 've been honored for a few years of <unknown> , and i 'm going to do this here in the hope of trying to achieve a long future in the sky ,
zero , is it true ? today , i think it 's coming , i was ready , thank you . thank you . thank you .
<unknown> .
yes , thank you very much .
these are my three points that i want to talk to the <unknown> minutes of a little bit of a little bit of a <unknown> minutes .
why are we today in the phosphorus or today , how much clustering ?
how do we get to the <unknown> ?
and all of all , what do you do , what do you do ?
what 's real , what 's the real thing about this ?
so let 's start with our first period .
the first part is perhaps a little bit noisy .
but it also also is to start with the challenges that we 're going to show , and the challenges is to show you .
a few years ago , for a few years ago , he was a difficult job of writing a lot of explain to make the kind of <unknown> to explain the way to explain the way to explain .
that 's what we 've got a problem today is , every child today , every child .
we 're in trouble with the future .
but it 's always always on the time , and it 's worth the challenges that population growth is important to the size of the size of the example .
all sorts of <unknown> <unknown> has been marketed to a lot of these tumors .
if you look at it in a certain long , you can see , in the event , the <unknown> , for example , the <unknown> , for example , this is a very short episode in the history .
we 're not going to imagine that we 're going to be different , as a little bit more different than that <unknown> is going down , and that 's the sun , and then it 's going to be moving .
you know the climate change that are the climate change that last last year years .
some of the say , `` well , once , it was <unknown> , and it was the way we had a <unknown> , and we 've been looking at the last <unknown> years ago .
you can also look at the same time , i think , if you 're looking at the same time , i 'm going to do it , i 'm wrong .
you can also say , who do n't need to get glaciers there ?
you can also also say , the ocean is far further .
but it 's going to be a little bit of a little bit of fun to do things that are really important to do things , but we just have to have trouble in the <unknown> , to the health care ,
<unknown> <unknown> is a long time about 100,000 degrees of <unknown> .
and there 's the amount of dollars , our habitats are like in between our cities like <unknown> or <unknown> , increasingly , even more expensive , more expensive than more expensive , more expensive than the same time , so far more bad .
but it 's also about the <unknown> , and the way that you 're about , it 's in asia , in asia , in asia , in asia .
think about the himalayas where the big cortex , and the <unknown> of them are all they left down there to go out there , and then they get down to the himalayas .
it 's not last time that all the time is about the planet .
the planet is the planet that we put in the planet , which we have , there 's a lot of economic crises .
and <unknown> , but it 's about the people that are people to be in a fundamentally changing the environment in which we 're going to be in life , that are being invisible , in the connectivity of life ,
it 's about the biodiversity to biodiversity .
the roots are <unknown> .
the gulf is going to be less less .
this is the atlantic where the <unknown> has driven by the ethiopia of a cotton , which is a part of the cotton .
and what happens , what happens to you ?
all these things , i 'm going to make myself all the things in the way , or in a way , or in other form with the global <unknown> , so we 're using the global <unknown> together .
what we 're doing is to do all of the whole world from what we 're growing up .
not only , the oil and the plants and the currents , but also the renewables of the power is so <unknown> , but last of the things that we 're doing is really possible .
and we just want to look at how we use so much like this , we can take something out of it , but also , to change the end of the risk of income and save it .
so it 's about , it 's in the <unknown> , and in fact , the <unknown> was actually <unknown> to the whole lot of <unknown> movements , and also , it 's also dramatic changes by the <unknown> .
that 's the challenge , not just the numbers , not only about c , two of the car , which is a very different way to make a different sense of a different way to do things like a different way .
in other places , to connect to the world , ''
our technology is completely changing , but we 're changing the new planet .
so , whenever we look at the next time and the <unknown> and the <unknown> , and there are still on the earth that are happening all the way that live in the <unknown> , a <unknown>
in a <unknown> , there was the same time in the most interesting time of human history , three years of three tons .
today it 's 20 to 20 to the <unknown> to the <unknown> .
so <unknown> <unknown> this guy 's <unknown> .
and it 's very , very <unknown> distributed distributed on earth .
it 's only more north america , more than we 've been born to now than more than us are more than for us , is the world 's <unknown> .
and in other parts of the world , you see , we have much more , more powerful , so far , less much less than less .
and it 's , we 're going to take the implications of ourselves , the rivers of the plants , the air is much better , and we 've been a lot of time better in the last few decades , but it 's basically that we have been able to have this in other parts of the world .
and the other parts of the world is going to make it less than the world , and i still seem to be less than anything else .
and so , the conflict that we see is the <unknown> , is , afghanistan , where it 's going to look at the bottom of the american <unknown> , and then you see where the products came from .
and that 's what it 's particularly very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , there are a lot of resources that are there 's a lot of resources where there are the most pristine way of the world .
so if we want to keep the air , we have to start with the topic of the first slide .
so we have to change the future of the ecological borders , the <unknown> is all the time .
and what we 've done in the life of this is what 's life of <unknown> is not <unknown> .
this has been the author named when he said , `` the fact , '' the world has been enough for everybody 's issues , but not for anyone to ask , but not for everyone ,
and there we are , like , we 've seen as a while we 've been doing this in the average , and in fact , in a average , we 've got a lot of land on it .
so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so
this was the kind of <unknown> part of it .
but i think , think , you think , you need to make it really helps you understand what it is about changing .
even if i was saying , i 'd say , it was worth how to feel different , it 's more than living , but more than <unknown> <unknown> .
but it 's always a little bit more , and the <unknown> <unknown> takes a responsibility , i 'm going to be a confession to tell you , i 'm going to say goodbye .
so what 's really <unknown> ?
and we have to have that we have all the parts of our world 's future around the world , and especially in quality of quality , we do n't really be able to really do
here 's a pretty good mood , but there are people , and you know people , people also can not be able to do all the same things with this story .
i 've been talking about it .
<unknown> and climate change climate change have the same cause of the same cause of the same cause .
we 're too busy and too much , and too much , so much , so much , so much , so much , so much , so much , so much , so much .
this is on the side of the <unknown> , we 're actually going to work , and eventually it 's too much .
i also love to love very much to play very much .
on the other hand , we just just <unknown> this <unknown> <unknown> , and we just <unknown> this <unknown> structure .
what is then then what 's going to live good ?
how can we define this ?
now , like a little friend of <unknown> , a <unknown> scientific thing .
and what i said to know about this , and i 'm going to say , `` i 'm going to ask you a lot of <unknown> , '' but here 's what it 's about , is that how do we feel what i really want to define ?
and there 's a problem , it 's important to think that the best life has ever been two things .
quality people have the issue of an effective act as a sense of what i 'm going to do what i 'm going to eat .
did i put a roof on the head ?
did i wish my friends ?
i mean , i think , i can think , can i mean , can i think that 's a life , i can be able to be grateful in life ?
but it 's like , how do i do it , how do i do it ?
i 'm going to give you the <unknown> quality of the evil quality .
and then i call two <unknown> , which i think is the <unknown> developments that are important in the context of the point .
one is a problem .
the need is the very fundamental dimension of our human development , and there 's a way to think of emotions , and that 's how it 's also emotions .
if we can fix our needs , we 're happy , we 're happy , and we are happy .
and you ca n't say , you need to say , you need to say , you need to say , you have to say , you have to use the use of pesticides or not sustainable or not sustainable .
demand for the element of depression is not going to be <unknown> , is not to the <unknown> , and not a <unknown> , and not a <unknown> , and not a <unknown> , and not a <unknown> , and not a <unknown> , and not a <unknown> , and not a <unknown> , and not a <unknown> , and not a <unknown> , and not a <unknown> , and not a <unknown> , and not a <unknown> ,
what are the need ?
but if you can imagine a couple of scientists , i 've just called a <unknown> , which is just two <unknown> .
and so , of course , there 's the physical needs , but also , it 's also need to be even more effective , using social relations .
for conserving , after 1985 , after the way , after the way , after creativity , after the way , after some of us , after we decided to act for freedom , freedom , freedom .
and all of this has been something that 's what you 're doing with money to do with money .
but to a really part of it , you do n't really know , but the question is , how i 've done , i 've been looking at the inside of my life .
and i 'm in the second important term for the word `` universal belief . ''
the strategies .
the strategy that i use the use of being a message to the privilege of all of this one .
and there 's now there , it 's all that i can do with a high school or a high <unknown> , or with a low <unknown> .
there 's only one of the time i need to have a lot of money or need to make a little or more money .
strategies are just a way that my mind is like to the ideas that i would come to my own <unknown> .
that 's what i do with the values with the values with the resources , with the possibilities that i 've been doing .
if i have a little money , i 'm going to try to make a lot of money , as if i do n't think about how much i put a lot of money on the other .
it 's the first thing to do is the <unknown> , which is the roof about the head , to eat , and then the way we look like the <unknown> , and the way we can do is the <unknown> .
and then it goes back to this , and it can be with a lot or a <unknown> <unknown> , that can be a sustainable or <unknown> or <unknown> .
and if we have all the technologies that are available to me to make my needs to protect my needs , we then talk about how to be a lifestyle , we then have a <unknown> .
so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so
this was the kind of scientific <unknown> .
and now , what is we now now ?
what is it like ? how is it ?
and just simply just some of the things that you have just some of the evidence of the ant .
of course , it must be difficult to find everybody else to be able to do themselves .
but the evidence of the whole species of a new way of knowledge , here 's where i 've been talked about technology , and also , in a political way .
what can we do ?
what can we do ?
what do we do ?
so , what do we want to do ?
the beginning of the beginning of the start , in the beginning , i think , is the danger that we 're going to be used to be more efficient that we 're more likely to use more resources more efficiently .
and finally , the first thing the patient 's blind is the same time , because the effects are still getting worse than the effects are going to be lost worse , and then we 've got to go back to the last end .
or if we can do it , in a different direction that can take us to any other , and less logical , but there are less susceptible to a lot of quality of the brain quality .
there 's a gentleman of my favorite clips , maybe you know a few of the <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> , which is more difficult quality of the <unknown> , so much more quality with money ,
there 's a lot of technology like me , i can give each other thing that we use the computer , the orange juice , the <unknown> , the <unknown> , how can i do it ?
in essence , i can produce today , i can build the house , and i can play the family , and then come out of a <unknown> , and so unstable .
to do something that 's going to make more difficult to make more <unknown> or to make the same quality quality of life .
my teacher , <unknown> <unknown> has been <unknown> , which is a <unknown> <unknown> per capita income , and then we 're in the first time , and that 's where we 've been talking about , and then it 's going to be able to look at it too much .
where are we all of the need ?
what services can i do in common ?
and how can i do this with the little <unknown> , i can do something like this ?
and not with a little bit of a <unknown> , but it 's not a little bit of <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> percent less less than less than less than less than a half .
there are many examples there 's a few examples of what we can do , and , there are a few ways that can be able to do , as well as possible , so many of us can be able to do .
in luxembourg , a tower is built a tower , which is built by 20 <unknown> , which is a <unknown> <unknown> .
with seven <unknown> , it 's been <unknown> at the <unknown> <unknown> in the <unknown> , which is built in a <unknown> .
and basically the styrofoam atoms are made of pieces of wood .
you know , if you can do it , it 's going to be more likely to take more and going back to the bottom and not even in a way , and so many , as much as a lot of money , you can go to the number of people with the next time , and the goal is to be
but what 's really interesting is that we 're going to do a lot of our own , a way , how do i think , how do i think of it , what are i really concerned ?
<unknown> <unknown> wrote a great book , written written about a great book , <unknown> <unknown> .
and he 's like , how hard it is , it 's very difficult to end up with the way of a way from the treadmill of this convention .
the <unknown> , i want to go to some other monkeys , and then i 'm going to be in the end of the time , and then i 'm a lot of time in this in the inside of this in a lifetime .
you feel like <unknown> , who i 've been able to impress , and i 'll follow the fast , and then i 'm going to give the new one of these new beings .
i was the best of the most popular statements i 'm going to do the <unknown> , which you all know .
when i was my college , i was writing my final couple of years ago , we 've got to give back letters letters .
then you have to go back to the letter , and you can read the letter back to me , i 'm going to give you a <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i write hundreds of email that i 'm talking about hundreds of hands .
and i can do a lot more efficiently .
this is productivity , which is efficiency , which is economic growth , we 're going to get back to the first economic growth , and we 're going to come back to the first time .
but i did n't really have time to change .
i did n't do it for me , really , i did n't do it for me .
but there are good examples , so , if you 're doing this food , i think , like , what i really want to take your quality of quality and the spirit of the <unknown> , the <unknown> in the foreground ,
and with a very small <unknown> , we can make a lot of <unknown> quality of life , and you can make a lot of living quality life .
one of my favorite stories of my favorite is a <unknown> <unknown> .
there 's been already about today , which is the average person in india , in about average 10 years ago , about 10,000 years of the household .
can you start to imagine .
who had two who has two generations , three generations of the things had had had been received , they had killed , <unknown> employees .
the thing we 've done is that we 've done , and the people we 've done , is the thing we 've done .
we have to do it ourselves , and we have to do it anyway .
and fewer people still have clear clear to the way that we have to understand all of these sorts of options .
and the possibility that we need to do is to do that is helping us to do that is that we think we 've got to do that , that 's the way that we 're doing , so we 've got to do that in the <unknown> of the <unknown> things .
for example , i think , is perhaps a <unknown> of a <unknown> , which is the way that you 're going to go to the fact that i 'm not going to be a few things out of the <unknown> .
the next example of this is a result of use , is even more effective .
a <unknown> boom .
star , <unknown> , <unknown> has been <unknown> somehow a few years ago , and perhaps in a few years ago , it was developed in a massive parts of years .
in the meantime , the world is more of the more people if you think about <unknown> ,
if you think , think about the thinking of thinking about <unknown> .
<unknown> , business models just work on , how can you know , the great thing we 've already have seen these beautiful <unknown> here , and there 's been a lot of a hundred hundred years ago , and then only about the more successful
that what is to do is to make people work better .
that 's the final thing is , the last thing is , the question of justice is the question of justice .
i 've been told you something like a <unknown> , which is what it means is that it 's like this picture , that 's a picture of the city between africa and europe and a <unknown> of a world .
so , as you know , all of the time , the same thing that can do is that the same thing is able to do with these kinds of ways that you can do is that if you can do it can be possible , if we 're using a little bit more than we can get a less efficient .
and that 's not the less quality of life , because lots of us have been asked to have a lot of us , and have a lot of us have a lot of time .
but it 's a important task of the economy , the company , these products , the services to make us need to create a good life with much less resources .
i think , last decade , this is also something that we do with the great politics , to do , to be the <unknown> , to the <unknown> , i call it the time .
if you 're looking at a little bit of the effects , it 's gone from brazil , it 's <unknown> , methane , the <unknown> of every week we 've got this light-sensitive <unknown> back to the bottom of the <unknown> .
it 's said , the crisis is about my door and also , what we 've been talking about is how much as we 've been talking about , and how do we have to do , there 's the numbers for austria , they find the same for all countries to growth .
and there 's no reason to have access to growth , so , as i like this , i was about the way of my youth , from the years , you know , for example , in the years ago .
part of the fact that has a profound problem of mathematics , and so , in fact , a special reason for reasons .
one point five percent growth is so much as a percent percent is happening from a thousand years ago .
and the eight percent is what happened in what china has happened today .
these are also a place where there were many of us , and maybe there were all of the <unknown> , we were going to die twice .
in fact , when it 's a poet , is more than eight percent <unknown> <unknown> .
one percent has still been a lot of time now , so that 's where we 're going to do well , so we 're going to go back to the same thing .
but you have to put it in a way that says , `` no even if we had zero to growth , it 's because the last year and eat and have been in and then , and how to have a <unknown> and <unknown> like that year .
we can invest good , and we can make good , and we can actually work well well , and we can actually work on it , and we can actually work on it , and we can actually work on it , and we can actually work on it .
this is also not just <unknown> , because you know , these statistics knows that , which is the number of bacteria that are going to be the equivalent of the population of all the quality of life .
the economy is growing , but the quality of life in the country remains in the countries of the countries of the world that we are .
and by the way , the jobs are also not sustainable , and that 's not something that we 're all about , as well as we 're going to be , as we 're going to go back to us , and we 're all going to be <unknown> .
that 's simply not just , and it 's not just going to be able to share with the timeline .
and it goes back and always more and more , so that it 's also how fast as a <unknown> or next week , to be , in my trend , i think , in the trend , a bigger story with this topic , looked at
and what <unknown> <unknown> is , <unknown> <unknown> , who was a nobel laureates in his <unknown> , and he said that he 's saying , the good life of the good economy , the good <unknown> <unknown> <unknown>
that 's what the end of all of the world 's not going to be able to do , to be not just about biomass in the way that you can not deal with stability , not to reduce growth , which is not in the future of our lives ,
for 36 milliseconds , and so many countries , also in china , for india , it 's also a different story of another thing .
and that 's going to be under the <unknown> , if we grow up , and we 're going to grow up , and we just like , on the level , to the high level of the <unknown> , where we are good to live and
it 's also going to have the capacity to do it , and it 's also going to be the politics .
it needs to be beneficial .
it takes the obvious thing to say , `` the economists '' is the best thing .
it does n't need it as a way that , and it takes a really important and measure of the thinking , and we should be thinking , and i think , `` what is it that the matter of what 's quality , is it ?
is the goat ?
after our politicians measure the politicians , we can measure .
of course , how are the <unknown> of the <unknown> ?
how does that come together ? how much together ?
we need a fundamental aspect of the fact that the <unknown> finally have to grow the <unknown> and not the work .
who is the ones who are in the ones of the entrepreneurs , they are also , but the most vulnerable , knowledge that really well , it 's very well .
what kind of thing we do with the food system , we 've been told to have a colleague of time , and we 've been paid to have a colleague of time .
you could do that same way .
the resources are skillful , and so they 're going to get the resources , and the thing that they do , and the things are going to do , and not the work of the world 's games , and not the work of the power .
and you have to get past all of the time to do that , to create jobs , to provide the <unknown> , to health , health , infrastructure without infrastructure .
and that 's what it 's doing is a little bit of hard work .
this is , like , i think , even , if you can work in the neighborhood , it can work in this direction , we can also be able to design the right products , to grow our tools , services , we can ask , how do we do , how do we do , how do we do , how do we do , how do we do , how do we do , how do
what do we need and what do we need to do , what do n't we do n't we do ?
the state politics , who have the <unknown> government that <unknown> the mechanics .
i was a couple of evidence that i 've been sending out .
and last time , of course , the science of <unknown> percent of all the <unknown> is still going to be even in the direction , how can we <unknown> growth growth ?
but unfortunately , unfortunately , none of the time you have n't done it .
if you look at the effects of the view of the view of the first time you look at the development of the last 20 years , it 's always going to go to the bottom , because it 's not going to be .
the politics are not going to be able to create the growth , but the way we 're not going to do , but that 's the question as we go to the way we 're doing a good life of this ?
so , it 's <unknown> , and it 's it , and it 's it . it 's doing it .
if the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> you went to open up lake .
with heart , the physical , the other hand , and the end of the time , we 're going to be the <unknown> , we 'll need to do it .
thank you very much .
i 'm a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
and i love this city .
this city has so many of the projects that we 've been doing so many stories .
one of them has been a couple of years ago .
and in fact , with a lot of work with creative terms .
on the creative problem , i 'm going to go to the world , and i 'm going to come up and i 've got a little bit later later , and i 'm going to tell you a little bit later later .
it 's going to do to do with the <unknown> <unknown> , and you can do it by the <unknown> <unknown> .
this is a <unknown> , which is <unknown> here in the middle of town , and lots of the city also <unknown> and <unknown> .
another story before it .
it was at a <unknown> summer in <unknown> , nevada , <unknown> .
a man is , like , when it was like , you know , a guy 's just in his home , and it 's actually going to be right there in the home of the home , and it 's actually <unknown> <unknown> .
it 's being <unknown> to warm .
he 's europeans , he 's not going to <unknown> the <unknown> with the heat .
he makes a <unknown> , he 's pulling the wire from a <unknown> <unknown> , not so much for us , and twice a lot of light there , and it 's a paltry dark in it .
he lays the <unknown> again , he 's his <unknown> away , and he 's turning it to a new climate in the wild .
it 's the <unknown> , which is n't a joke , he 's born , no .
and this number , you see here is the moment in the <unknown> of the <unknown> <unknown> of the ted <unknown> .
a company has been built by the company , which is built by four , four of them , and four of them , and you know , four .
one of other things that you know is , or somebody else knows it .
he has the original idea that even <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> .
both both have been done .
so he says , `` well , '' i think , well , <unknown> , i put my own business .
<unknown> <unknown> he goes to the stock market .
now , now , today , several thousand people who are now spending many thousand employees in <unknown> <unknown> in the <unknown> living in the world in the world where we have the world 's population , and the world 's population is .
so much , for a lot of creative terms of ideas , as a problem of human consciousness .
why not do something new , what 's not yet ?
and so , perhaps jack <unknown> , ever thought the question is <unknown> with <unknown> <unknown> .
if you do n't know what you 're doing is n't really , is it something that 's a chance for a problem ?
and the question that i 've been doing is that the thing that i 've been doing is really asked me to try and make a question for often , is difficult to work , difficult to work , too difficult situations .
if something is wrong , if something was wrong , or my <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> or me , i could n't care or <unknown> , or whatever it is , and whatever it is .
<unknown> , little <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> .
what is this opportunity ?
and you 've already come from the <unknown> , and you 've got to the <unknown> in the <unknown> .
what the power is to make me <unknown> with this example here , which is something that i described , and this is something that i described , this is something that i 'm talking about this .
and another example of the one is been taken from the <unknown> <unknown> of <unknown> , and the <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> <unknown> of <unknown> <unknown> .
and the idea of how to help people be able to be able to get your own insurance .
i want to show you a few examples of showing you here .
so , actually , that 's actually , in fact , the way the <unknown> was <unknown> , and it has done it , and it has done it , it 's a <unknown> .
i 'm a <unknown> ' <unknown> that 's fantastic .
my son did n't have the woman who was not <unknown> , the <unknown> did n't <unknown> .
it 's just a <unknown> , and the <unknown> woman is the woman 's <unknown> through the <unknown> <unknown> .
or i had a whole bunch of plants as i grow up the street , and suddenly , a <unknown> , and a very sudden in a part of my thoughts and i could n't see the other car more than the same time .
and the answer that is it that 's true , who 's a matter , or , what ?
the bush .
the <unknown> <unknown> are <unknown> .
i 've been <unknown> , and two years ago , and i 've been <unknown> almost two and two times almost died .
and i can also tell me about half the half a kilometer of a <unknown> farm .
the last one was not a self-perpetuating attack .
and the <unknown> woman in the hospital was a young woman in the <unknown> .
if you 're a man , there 's a man , someone 's going to give you some explanation on this .
but if you were a woman , you have a woman , you do n't have it , you do n't know it .
so people are creative , we 're creative , we are creative .
and i wish to me and i wish to you that i 'm hoping that we can use all of us to use more of these sorts of things that we 're going to use more of these creativity .
many of us are in a <unknown> <unknown> of us , and we 're in a <unknown> <unknown> .
and it does n't have to be so that .
why not do things do different , if we just make different different places ?
old things that we 're doing is that they 've been doing the ones that are just being able to get rid of them , but maybe they were all going to be <unknown> or <unknown> , as a result .
why not only do n't just make different different , the <unknown> , as a simple <unknown> , <unknown> little <unknown> , <unknown> .
and there 's so much that there 's been a company company , who are using the company , and the use company is that , the use of the brain companies that are the same way .
for example , there 's this <unknown> , who are <unknown> these <unknown> , you could use this distinction , or the wall , for example , '' because you might be able to do that , because you might be able to do that , because you know , `` you know , you know , `` you know , you know , `` you know , you know , `` you know , you know , ``
another way , is a way of a problem , or why ?
the coffee is a matter of how instead of getting your bed nets , you can do it .
or so what happens .
we do n't have a <unknown> , <unknown> , you can see , and you know , <unknown> <unknown> .
it 's already today 's already <unknown> today , or what 's happened today ?
if you ca n't do anything to take cell phone or so on the mobile phone .
or eat food , i <unknown> , we owe both of them .
now , but , frankly , creative .
so it 's something like it needs .
i was one of the people or the one who would say , `` if you were going to <unknown> the <unknown> , and i would say , `` well , '' `` i mean , okay , i like , i 'm going to try and do all , i like , i like , i like , i like , i like that , i like that .
i 'm out of the <unknown> .
a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> in the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> the <unknown> <unknown> , and it 's <unknown> in <unknown> .
once the sports once once the latest news , once we have the universal news , even the politics are about the world .
if you were three times about the long time on the ground , you have been a <unknown> on the ground , you 're <unknown> .
once the whales got the day for the day of the day , they were <unknown> to the time of <unknown> long after the war .
it 's a <unknown> building , and the restaurant was very small , so that the chefs had all the money to do the same thing .
it was too deeply connected to everything .
so , what we 're thinking , is , are , are , are , are , are we , are we doing ? what do we do ?
how do we solve the problem with this problem ?
we ca n't be faster if we can not be in the kitchen . ''
now , the idea is that we 've been found out with this idea .
on the table , there 's a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> on the screen tvs , and limor <unknown> and <unknown> , and a <unknown> .
so that that would be the <unknown> in the happy in the bottle of the food that they would have to be used to go to the <unknown> , or the <unknown> was going to be <unknown> .
just just imagine different .
a creative idea , and maybe even after the problem of the problem , but maybe in the <unknown> , but also , with the <unknown> of the problems , but perhaps also , with the <unknown> of the problems .
there 's a person who 's not going to be here , you 're not just talking about power here , not just here , you 're not just here today , right ?
and this person is the person 's <unknown> , the <unknown> of the <unknown> , so the <unknown> of the <unknown> , so the <unknown> of the <unknown> , so the <unknown> of the <unknown> , so the <unknown> of the <unknown> , so the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
but the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> the <unknown> trail .
i was the second day , which is a half day , so it takes a city , so four days .
a company has <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> to the <unknown> of the month , and maybe you may know , what they 're doing , and so you know , which is , which means .
a <unknown> says , `` i 'm going to say , `` <unknown> , '' thank you , we 're going to be happy .
people are coming to come back to us to <unknown> us all of the time .
the skies are full , and it 's <unknown> <unknown> , people are living in their own , because each of course , after each other , after each other , to come up by a <unknown>
but why not even though we have a technology to use and use it to feel creative from his own power ?
sometimes , creativity also had <unknown> <unknown> inequality .
and it 's coming from a <unknown> of a <unknown> , like this company that you might know .
so we have said that there 's no matter of the <unknown> , but it 's not too much more likely to have the capability of the <unknown> , but it 's actually a <unknown> .
or in the car , in the car , in the car , '' and in the car , in the car .
we know the other , the other , the different , <unknown> , and all kinds of directions .
yes .
why not does n't know a piece of <unknown> in the car , if you 're <unknown> <unknown> ?
or by a result , there 's a lot of ways to make a lot of ways to make the creative way of making it as well as the creative way .
and all of this has just done with the idea of humor , with joy , sometimes it 's ridiculous , <unknown> , <unknown> ?
sometimes it 's funny . it 's funny , so it 's funny .
once in my father , my favorite son was in my office .
and in this case , i 'm in this cartoon of my mind .
so , we 've got multiple <unknown> <unknown> around the <unknown> <unknown> around the <unknown> .
and then he goes from the left to the right , he 's pleasure , and i got to tell me my closest <unknown> for you , please clap , that 's not a playground here .
he reminded me , looking at me , <unknown> eyes , but the same thing , the playground eyes .
and in the moment , i 'm really going to be really excited about it , right ?
why is this not a playground ?
why is what we do , not the only of adults ?
that 's a lot of fun , but it 's a lot of fun , or guess ?
if we 're familiar , if we 're going to use our talents , we can use what we want to do .
and so , by the way , the <unknown> effect , but they 're very sensitive , but blinded to the way .
the picture is that if a certain day of the week is going to change what 's going on in our brain , you 're going to do in our brain .
it 's the first day in the week , and somehow , our focus is a focus on another week .
so the other day we were really <unknown> , and we were more likely to get out of the other day .
so , on the weekend , so , on the weekend , '' and so forth , so that 's the way we 're doing this in the weekend .
you also hear the media , you know , the media is about the media .
in fact , `` <unknown> '' says `` just a day until a day until the weekend to the weekend .
or if the <unknown> is the <unknown> era of september of the year , the graduate school .
what are the rest of the most <unknown> weeks of the year ?
is it so terrible ?
do we all have nice jobs ? well , how do you so nice jobs ?
a <unknown> , it had been given to the <unknown> , and she had a <unknown> on the <unknown> , that moment .
yes , i can go on a road , and i can go , and i 'm the ones that you sit in the rest of you , and i do n't think of your rest of your hands .
or on the side of the <unknown> , on facebook , all around social social life will be <unknown> .
once i started through the <unknown> , i was one of the <unknown> , a <unknown> of the <unknown> in <unknown> , and i had a <unknown> <unknown> in <unknown> .
there 's many business and i like to talk to what i 'm looking for .
what have the deal in the <unknown> , what are there ?
and one day i had a <unknown> in this business <unknown> at this business .
and the first sign you see here is , yes , that 's actually pretty nice .
so , with the way , to do with work , rather like to love things like that .
i was so that , i also had this , my father 's five children , but i was speaking five years ago , but i love my work at work .
yes .
and i 'm a <unknown> sign for <unknown> <unknown> , the <unknown> sign sign .
why the face represents a <unknown> that makes it possible , and more and more , and more and more , and more and more , and more and further , and it 's still going to continue to continue .
somebody has been as a answer to this point , it 's not the obstacle , it 's not the bicycle , it 's your jobs .
and i actually even wanted to leave the finger together , and then come back and go , and say , `` well , okay , change your life .
what 's my job is beautiful ?
the headline is , even if it 's the pink glasses , it 's the same thing , it looks everything very well , just as it looks like earlier .
so , you know , to talk to a nice thing , is not beautiful , it 's not really good to work .
the pink skies , then , the pink skies is to the great privilege of the sound of a foot to go to the bike .
and then you put a wonderful thing to fly the fly that you would be in the eye , and then you 'll end up in the eye .
but , to <unknown> , they 're not <unknown> .
what is the way that we 're going to do that if we do n't change this ?
actually , the job , the content , our <unknown> , our <unknown> , is that <unknown> ?
within the company , on the way , a <unknown> , as a <unknown> , as a <unknown> , as a <unknown> , and the <unknown> , and the <unknown> .
it might end up in a system where we feel like the mouse as well as we feel like the mouse .
the mouse goes up in this wheel and walk around and go and forth , and eventually , and eventually , it 's going to quickly it , and then it 's going to get it up the same speed , and you see it 's
what makes the mouse right ? but what does the mouse mean ?
you know , there 's nothing else , it 's going to be in a <unknown> , and it 's in a <unknown> in the <unknown> .
and again , again , again , and again , maybe , the movie day , and then maybe the movie day <unknown> the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , you could actually make sense of the bottom , you know , they can analyze it , because they can see the way they were doing .
this is beautiful <unknown> here at ibm , and it 's fun , and it 's always going to go and get it back and then again , again , and then again , again , again , and then again , again , again , again , and then again , so back again .
and what we 're feeling as a funny thing , is a funny thing , the odds of the script is a concussion , but what ?
or something that takes takes is that <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
i was so much of a hundred years ago , and i was so much more years ago when i was walking home from one of my sons , and i was walking home from one of my sons .
and once again , the street was sitting in me , it was pretty few of the home of my eyes and somehow i 've been trying to stay in .
the next day i went to the doctor , and i thought , `` well , what was going on here ?
he looked at me and he said , `` oh , no way , '' is actually going to be a lot of all of all of the things in all .
but what is it looking at the way that <unknown> like this ?
and i looked at my job to see that , and i saw it , i worked in the two weeks weeks and i was working on me and i was doing it work to me .
after a years ago , when you have the <unknown> and <unknown> , who have been first first to first questions in the early age , we could do that , at the first time , we 've been able to do it at the end of the first time .
i also thought i thought , well , what else is there for a few years , and what is it possible for work ?
and i started to investigate , <unknown> , other people make a little bit of a little bit of <unknown> , and i could n't even know that i had time with my family with my family , and something that i do n't do with me .
<unknown> , whether or not , if it 's not a good species of <unknown> , there 's no <unknown> in my job , and a new design system .
i realized that the <unknown> studies that i 've been talking about , many of the species of big groups , who are doing me to be happy about it .
i 'm going to go to the literature and <unknown> and other things , but these would give us the extra dimensions to allow us to give people back to me , who are scared to me feel good .
and it was n't always like this .
i have to have to have to find yourself that those <unknown> sounds sick of a little bit more aggressive .
and sometimes it has to get this little back to the sheet of the back , and i got to be <unknown> from me , and she was a <unknown> , and she was a heart attack , and he starts to start with <unknown> , and he starts to start with it .
in fact , when i said , you 'd go to work with you , he 's always always going to me go back , i 'm talking to your walk and so .
he 's going to do it .
so , so , in short , <unknown> , it 's <unknown> , in the right thing , but at some point we 're going to go to a while , and eventually we 'll go to play together .
what happens ? what happens ?
in fact , the first line is all going to be a healthier .
the <unknown> <unknown> goes down , but a curve that 's happening is , is the diseases of a human being in a health tool .
<unknown> <unknown> four percent in the last 10 years ago , <unknown> 's almost 70 percent , which is beautiful , that 's beautiful , this is less .
the more important risk plus <unknown> <unknown> percent .
so what 's something that i think , is i mean , is to be so much ?
why is this ? so why ?
is that only in austria alone , so in austria , is that way ?
no , in germany , it 's like germany in the workforce , it 's like this .
<unknown> , <unknown> , that 's going to be living in a healthier society , which will be all more losses .
this is so on the right side to see here on the left side .
in the same way , <unknown> diseases are almost a number of two percent within the last 10 years , a <unknown> large <unknown> is a huge big <unknown> out of the size .
the number of <unknown> <unknown> takes the <unknown> .
the cost of the cost is the cost .
and it 's important to think all sorts of odor , what can we do with this topic with this topic ?
so , sometimes i think , to do , you know , sometimes , you know , sometimes , you know , <unknown> also <unknown> the <unknown> , and also , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , like one , here , for example .
so good news is really about what 's meant to do .
and somebody once said , no no word is not a clever thing , but no alcohol is not a solution .
but what is the thing to take this thing ?
what 's the scariest thing that we do it again is more and more and how to feel it ?
and that has been fascinated me to the last year .
i think of think there is a kind of thing that <unknown> <unknown> like this is possible for a way that can be that one ?
i 'm a <unknown> , who 's a job , that 's not what the <unknown> is not what you can do and make it possible and be able to do with it .
there are many other things that are important , family , health , health , faith and so on .
but the fact is that we 've spent the same part of our greatest part of our <unknown> lives in time .
and if we do that , why do n't do that , it does n't do that , it 's about the best , and it 's too other and also to other people , and others .
the <unknown> <unknown> i 'm going to give you to be <unknown> by the first time of the first time for example to last year , and to do the <unknown> , and to <unknown> the <unknown> .
these little <unknown> that you may seem to discover it immediately , it 's always accepted by the way .
<unknown> is a <unknown> , with talent , <unknown> and environment , and it 's a way of relationship with the <unknown> , and it 's a <unknown> , and it 's a <unknown> , and it 's a community , and it 's a community , and it 's a community , and it 's a community , and it 's a community , and it 's a community , and it 's a community , and it
what is the <unknown> of what i call my talents ?
in what i live in , i think that could be , what do i think , is to do with anyone ?
what the freedom i am trying to do to do that , what i want to do , what do i want to do ?
because the national <unknown> , the <unknown> of the <unknown> , which is <unknown> us .
the more of them , more more , more more than more stressed out more than the more detail .
and what do i do ? what do i do ?
the stakes can do it , and it 's a way to get the effort to do that .
that 's where these four areas are going to come up with these four areas .
and it can anybody every one of every time , imagine that , you can imagine .
i had to do that , and i had to look for me myself for myself , and i 'm going to go back to the years ago and i 'd go to go back to the time , and i 'd go to go back to the time .
can i put my talents to these pieces of wood ?
what 's the environment ?
and that means , sometimes , i go into a plane with my laptop to <unknown> the <unknown> , and i can put a <unknown> , and a <unknown> .
the freedom .
which is what i call myself to do with me to do the thing about what i believe about what i believe about it .
i do it matter ?
the <unknown> .
the last example .
and then there 's always people say , well , the people that explain me explain why that 's not what we 're going to do .
and why not if you 're much more money , you know , is that much more difficult .
and then i 'd like to ask a question to a very good way of this , and i would like to answer a answer to this place .
who wants to find , it 's a way of ways .
who do n't have to do , who 's missing , of reasons , is reasons why .
and , in the way , you can choose to <unknown> the <unknown> , i can make sense of me , i 'll be able to make a sense of people or i decide i wished to help myself ?
and they 're going to have the right ones in both right .
so what do we do with our genomes ?
and one of them has given us all of the <unknown> <unknown> .
now , that 's a lot of small .
this is filled with thousands of time , with gold , with gold , with all of the ability to do with their skills .
what do we do ? what do we do ?
so , for the way , for the <unknown> , we ask us to do this , and we ask ourselves to tell us that , let 's face this .
or if we 're in the hospital or at the hospital , or at the end of a life , one of the life .
what did i do with my host ?
by the way , who do this thing , in the process of a <unknown> , i think , is to get <unknown> on it , you might be to get married here afterwards -- and then later , here are a few minutes of a meal .
so what we do with , and what we do with our own is , my own question is , i think , is a self , but i 'm a day , and every day .
`` i 'm a good job of <unknown> , i 'm going to make the good enough ?
resources .
there was something with a story .
i wanted to tell me about the <unknown> about <unknown> .
and i can do that , and i 've been able to do it in the place .
this system was the <unknown> of the <unknown> , which was about the <unknown> of the <unknown> as a <unknown> years ago , and the rest was coming on their enemies .
and the enemies that this was so that the <unknown> so that was so well that you could n't afford it , you could n't afford them , and i would n't ignore it .
buckminster walls are able to make a <unknown> , the <unknown> <unknown> movement to the red , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> .
it was a <unknown> <unknown> thought that there was a lot of time .
so the idea that all of the thinking about , if we do n't see , we 're going to go back , we put a <unknown> , we create a <unknown> ,
we do n't have a separate out of ourselves and there 's no longer there , and it 's in a way that we have in there , and it 's in a sense of the way that we are in there , and it 's in a sense of the way that we 're doing it in a way .
so , looking at the way we 've been looking at the city that are now .
the <unknown> had it long long until the day where came out of the day where the <unknown> were almost forbidden .
they only have a <unknown> , who was already on the way to be <unknown> , as the <unknown> <unknown> , once said , `` give me a little bit of email , and give me three days .
and you know , you know , <unknown> , you 've got you , i 'm going to be you to you , come up , grab the <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> , and <unknown> me .
<unknown> <unknown> is starting to the <unknown> way .
on the bottom , the enemies are the <unknown> like the wall of the <unknown> is a <unknown> , and then it 's going to go back to the right , and it 's in the early '90s , and it 's in the early end .
well , think , well , the thinking of a matter of what is a <unknown> , which is what it 's like .
it 's a moment .
again , a <unknown> <unknown> is a <unknown> , and on the wall of the <unknown> , the <unknown> is actually a black hole .
enemies are , think , oh , that 's two <unknown> , it 's going to take something something else .
and the same thing , the same thing is , the same thing , the same time , he 's the case that the <unknown> of the <unknown> is that the <unknown> that 's sitting there and the ability to get there , and then it 's only going to be able to go to the <unknown> .
at the end of the second day , after the six day after six , six months ago , you saw different <unknown> <unknown> , and she 's got up in a <unknown> in a <unknown> .
because they thought that we 're thinking about that long , we 're not going to have no longer , but we do n't think of ourselves .
after then , the <unknown> went down to the <unknown> and the <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
one one that you had and then you 've got and do you have the <unknown> .
and so these are the <unknown> <unknown> coming out of the <unknown> <unknown> patterns .
i like this idea that i think that there is everything that we have , and we have all of the things we have , and that we have all there .
sometimes there are science resources , sometimes it 's not much more , sometimes it 's not a little bit , sometimes it 's little bit more .
but also , we can do something to do something .
we do n't know what the power we do is to create the world a day , and we have to make the world every day .
and if you believe that might be a good samaritan , you can be a good <unknown> <unknown> right now .
in the spring , the spring of the spring .
and so , you come to the course .
and we 're doing there , you know , there 's a <unknown> in the rains there , and it 's going to be going to be able to get the water that 's going to be able to get the plants of <unknown> glass <unknown> <unknown> .
and they have done some of these scenarios of these things together , these are <unknown> coming from these blooms of fruits of these blooms of the <unknown> particles .
there 's a gentleman here , i 'm sorry to say , of course , here we 're very popular and who we have <unknown> and eat .
there 's a basis of the grain of this grain , we can actually use this grain of this room , and we 're <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> bread .
there are some animals that are going to eat the food chain .
there 's people who are people who eat the products that they would eat as the way we eat food now .
and it 's automatically automatically .
but if you think about it , you might think of it probably not so much , it 's not going to be all there , so it 's all going to be a fear and <unknown> .
and of course , this is probably not very lucky , but very clearly , but in the case , but in the case , the inside of the traits , the connection of the flower can do a very small tool , a different sense of the plant , and a big deal .
there 's a research research that show that show up to be a <unknown> percent of our food , not even more than the food that we have no bees .
so that sounds like this cartoon are because it 's so normal as we 're now in our way , and we may not be able to feel so much like this .
there was also a very interesting movie about a long interesting movie , <unknown> , <unknown> , for the subject .
and i 'm part of you , look at the look , look at it .
now , let 's look at the gentleman , who 's just talking about bees with bees , and the <unknown> in his <unknown> , in the way , the meaning of bees , which is kind of a moral <unknown> .
this is what he does at the school at the school at night , and he will tell us all of the stories about it .
please , mr. <unknown> .
yeah , good evening .
and just a big thing to say , `` i 'm just a big thank you , and i 've got to the whole <unknown> of the <unknown> . ''
that i 'm here with my project , <unknown> men , who are <unknown> to something about the human being , and the other human bees are .
and yet , there 's also under the wing , and one woman is a little bit more about a little bit more difficult to tell you , little fun , and it 's fun to make fun .
now , i think that the most famous ones of you have been involved in this is so that we 've been now going to be here today , and so we 're going to be a <unknown> company to work in <unknown> minutes into the sounds of the retina .
i do n't want to do n't know , no .
but maybe i can actually take that you to start this <unknown> , or a certain empathy of you , and you 're supposed to be using this for the <unknown> of the <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> .
my name is thomas <unknown> , i 'm a <unknown> years old , and founder of five <unknown> , not heard about <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> and working on the <unknown> of the <unknown> of <unknown> and <unknown>
i 'm a member of a <unknown> in the <unknown> <unknown> , and in the <unknown> <unknown> , and in the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
and working with work in the <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> <unknown> of <unknown> with our oldest students in the <unknown> .
we work there in the garden where the agriculture and the actual <unknown> , and the actual way that we are in the actual sciences .
<unknown> is actually a very <unknown> of <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> 's <unknown> <unknown> .
our flying classroom is more likely to be a <unknown> , a <unknown> , a silence , a quiet thing , and it 's a quiet thing .
and also , it also leads to the quiet .
it 's almost nearly a <unknown> piece of life .
and not enough , the other guys in the old greeks , the old greeks to make the connection between honey , so <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
and in a wonderful verse of homer , he <unknown> as the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> his <unknown> <unknown> to the <unknown> , and he 's also to try to avoid that he can also be again again .
but the <unknown> <unknown> does n't take themselves off , but they send their blue bees and the <unknown> of the <unknown> , and the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> with the mouth and <unknown> into the mouth and he <unknown> the <unknown> as the
a beautiful image .
hopefully i 'm going to leave you tonight and hopefully this evening .
yes .
this is a flying classroom .
i come to the project .
one of the <unknown> , that <unknown> , i 'm reading this <unknown> , i 've been working with my students with me , and then you 've got to work with <unknown> to 30 years ago , for <unknown> days in a <unknown> .
in <unknown> schools from us in <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> in the <unknown> of <unknown> , or the <unknown> of the <unknown> , and the <unknown> of the <unknown> , and the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
a <unknown> <unknown> or <unknown> , and in some of the <unknown> , and in some of the <unknown> , '' in a <unknown> in the <unknown> .
the teacher who 's this is a very <unknown> of me , and i 'm going to have a <unknown> , and we 're looking for a place to a place that 's a <unknown> place for a <unknown> , so that 's a <unknown> .
and most importantly , the same thing that you can see is the next time you can see something like the kids , and the same thing can be able to see , as the month , but if you see this month , these month .
and all of the things that we can do is the bees that are the ones that we can do , in the world , the way that we have in the <unknown> and they can be able to be able to do , and then we can <unknown> them back into the <unknown> .
and then they put the lights into a window of a window .
so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so
and then the whole thing that was starting to do was look at me in the <unknown> .
so i 'm going to take a <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> , and you can get a <unknown> <unknown> of a <unknown> <unknown> of two <unknown> , and we 're now <unknown> here at the <unknown> in the <unknown> .
and so important to this point on this screen of the <unknown> , you 're bees to use bees .
also , we think , we think of <unknown> , we 've got <unknown> <unknown> , and here , you have to have a lot of <unknown> fresh water , so it 's so fresh eggs , so that 's the eggs , so <unknown> eggs .
and then a <unknown> , then , you can see , a <unknown> , you can see , you know , a <unknown> , and on the top , i 'm going to come up here .
there 's the honey in the honey .
you need if you need , if you 're bad weather is , and you 're not going to fly , and they ca n't fly , and so forth , can be .
so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so
so that 's the way that it looks like this .
then the <unknown> comes back to the back and then immediately starts to go to the <unknown> places like the other places or the <unknown> area in the school , and in the way that we 're doing in the middle of the city .
and again , a wonderful story begins now .
ladies and gentlemen and those of these bees are there in the class there , and then every time in the class is always a moment of time , and a few years of thinking of a crisis ,
they do n't have more people . they do n't get more than anything .
they are lonely .
they find n't find their queen .
and that 's the most important problem of the <unknown> , if he <unknown> this ied that he 's doing it in the fact that the queen 's a <unknown> that the queen 's soul .
so that these are n't not in these two <unknown> maneuvers corner , and it 's a very <unknown> <unknown> .
and they 're sad sad and these machines .
they start to start with <unknown> <unknown> .
yes , the <unknown> says , `` the <unknown> , '' <unknown> .
you hear that .
it 's almost <unknown> about a higher higher than if they normally usually swim in your <unknown> with a queen .
and then a <unknown> is now beginning to go back to the <unknown> .
ladies and gentlemen , in a night , you 're now now to have the need to help the need for a human people , and all of this is happening without <unknown> , <unknown> , without conferences , without conferences , without having no
here 's the people , the people are all been able to follow and then , and then they 've got a <unknown> night there with a first night .
because without the queen , he 's no time that this could never be this american people , there were no organisms that have no longer yet .
because <unknown> <unknown> only only six weeks ago .
so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so
and in this first night , they 're just from one of these <unknown> <unknown> , a pencil of a pen , and they put it into this <unknown> chamber , and put it into this <unknown> chamber .
and then the <unknown> people would be sent to the queen , and then you should be called the queen 's <unknown> .
everybody who had been <unknown> from school , who would be like to say , `` how did you want to go to this ?
yes , <unknown> <unknown> are also <unknown> all the whole range of <unknown> , but all millions of <unknown> machines are also <unknown> .
that 's true .
and something is a wonderful way of time , and it 's now a wonderful thing about the right time .
this is what a real thing in which is actually going to be in the <unknown> <unknown> , it would be a <unknown> <unknown> , and the queen is a queen .
the egg has the first three days of the same genetic experience of how the code of the <unknown> .
after this time , it 's going to be using a <unknown> <unknown> of a <unknown> <unknown> .
you know that term .
and so , as it turns out , it 's going to immediately , when it 's going on , it 's going on , it 's like the way that the model of the code of the code of the model of the code of the genetic code .
the <unknown> industry will be built through the <unknown> effect in the <unknown> <unknown> , which is what it works .
we 've had this idea before we had to talk about what we eat , which is what we 're going to be , what we 're going to be , what we 're going to be , what we 're going to be , what we 're going to be , what we 're going to be about us , what we 're doing is about what we 're going to be like us .
and the queen is this really cool thing to experience .
so three days ago , <unknown> <unknown> , five days of <unknown> <unknown> .
and that 's the same thing that the students are doing all of the <unknown> .
you see that in the case of the science .
and then the cell is going to put it on a <unknown> , and it 's not going to happen because the people are now going to be <unknown> by saying or whether it 's a <unknown> , it 's like to say , or you 're going to say , `` you know , you know , you know , you know ,
no , that 's what happens , it 's <unknown> <unknown> .
ladies and gentlemen , that 's a <unknown> or a <unknown> decision , or a <unknown> decision .
and then the children 's friend 's sister 's her son , three of the five words , a friend of a friend , and i was a <unknown> <unknown> days for that the queen <unknown> .
and day , so if we 're going to happen , the teacher has the <unknown> of the <unknown> in the <unknown> , and the <unknown> is the <unknown> <unknown> in the morning at the morning , at the morning , yes .
and then the mother , just say , `` what is it that way to go to ?
yes , i have to have to school in school .
yes , why ? what ?
yes , our queen <unknown> .
yes ?
and then the night is about the morning , and the morning , six months ago .
and then the insurance <unknown> <unknown> on the <unknown> , because of the <unknown> , because if you want to <unknown> the sound of the <unknown> , so that the queen 's <unknown> now . ''
and if you really do that , you can hear this very well , you can hear something very well , and first , first , first , first , first , first , first , first , i think , right ?
this is the queen <unknown> .
so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so
another bit more than a higher than a half .
and then the nest maintenance workers are going to come up and get the queen and <unknown> the queen .
the first thing that the bee is doing , and you 're going to take her wings and you 're going to be with your <unknown> of this human , and her mind , she made a queen , her <unknown> , your <unknown> , your <unknown> , your <unknown> , her <unknown> .
now , people have a new way to go back to a identity .
now , three years of the three days of <unknown> for the three days , the <unknown> <unknown> this year .
the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> the <unknown> back to the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , and you can see her <unknown> <unknown> .
back in the middle of the <unknown> , from the people , from the people , from this <unknown> , from this <unknown> <unknown> .
and five years ago , this day , the queen <unknown> <unknown> from the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
so , i think , think of a thinking , well , i 've seen it , i 've seen a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a <unknown> , and a <unknown> in the <unknown> .
wait , <unknown> , <unknown> .
what 's different .
-- we do that . we do .
this one that 's called the queen , now , the <unknown> of the <unknown> <unknown> without <unknown> , without <unknown> , from this <unknown> way to come up to two miles a little bit of a half .
and you 've probably heard of you just seen in her wedding in the zeppelin .
in the <unknown> , and it 's in a <unknown> <unknown> , and there 's a <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> , so seven , twelve years ago , twelve deaths , the male bees .
so , like the world , as the people of different women are going to be the women , the queen , who have the seven , 18 , twelve seven years ago , and seven men has died of the men .
and the whole thing happens in a wonderful way in the middle of the television .
the drone comes from the back of the <unknown> , and the queen is now in this tour of the <unknown> , which is what it 's going to do is what you need to lose the three times for three years long .
for the drone , it 's also a <unknown> experience .
if you 're finished in the <unknown> , you 're going to merge it up and you 're dead dead from my sky .
and then the queen goes back and starts to try and go back to try and <unknown> the eggs .
there 's always one , two students in the class that you see the way that immediately looked at the moment , and then it turns out the way back immediately immediately .
and they also see the google , and the google 's eyes , and then they said the queen 's eyes .
yes , yeah .
and then the end of the school now , in the time , is the <unknown> <unknown> , and the <unknown> and the queen and the queen and the queen and the <unknown> , and the <unknown> , the <unknown> is the same thing to be now in there ,
and then i come to a moment , i come to a evening at the back of this conference .
<unknown> ' <unknown> , and the next morning i was doing this <unknown> <unknown> with the queen and the bees and i was doing this same <unknown> to the <unknown> and the bees to the <unknown> .
and here you see there is the queen there you go to the queen .
yes .
<unknown> <unknown> .
and it 's growing up to 10 to 60 to 12 meters 12 years ago , and <unknown> , too long .
and then the news is , these two <unknown> come here in the front page , now you 're going to come here in a <unknown> , and you 're going to come here in a <unknown> , and you 're going to come here in a <unknown> , and you get here in a <unknown> , and then you get here in a <unknown> , and then you get here in a <unknown> .
in a full telescope , a piece of the things , and a piece of things , and now , the people can be big and more , and the people will be enormous .
why bees are in the school of the school ?
ladies and gentlemen , the kids who have had ever been able to have forgotten , that never never experience that no longer never do before .
yes .
there 's not only that in the class , the students are all the time with the bees , but the entire school is coming in this class .
and the teachers , if he knows something if he can be something if he 's having a little bit more fun to do a time after the other .
look , bees and <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> years ago , we have a hotel room where people had <unknown> the honey .
a few months ago , in a few months ago , there was a <unknown> <unknown> old old days of people who have been able to find people who have been understood the bees .
any human culture has been <unknown> , and bees have <unknown> <unknown> bees .
and the other thing that bees are doing is , they were using the bees , and they were using the bees in every culture of this culture .
in china , in india , in india in india , in egypt , in greece , in greece , in greece .
they were all over the whole thing .
the human cultures , ladies and gentlemen , ladies and <unknown> , are in the everyday , ladies and i 've been , and i 've been <unknown> .
he can get a <unknown> , a <unknown> , he can <unknown> a <unknown> , and it can <unknown> a <unknown> .
ladies and gentlemen you know what flowers or men do the world bank <unknown> , which they need ?
that you see what you 're seeing something now , now in the summer in america , now in the summer in agriculture , we have in the dracorex in agriculture , and in the summer of the agriculture , we have the u.n. .
that 's what we did , there 's a green desert for our bees .
yes ?
he can go with the <unknown> with the <unknown> and then <unknown> men and <unknown> <unknown> , and how do n't we get to <unknown> and see how long do n't we have to go to the <unknown>
how long are they available on the risk of candy ?
and as long , they need to go back to go back to them long , they tried to go back back again .
it can <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
how do i <unknown> a <unknown> ?
yes .
you know whether it is that the <unknown> is the top of the <unknown> , or <unknown> , flat is flat here ?
look at the same time , look at the same time .
he can be a math -- a <unknown> piece of furniture .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can actually <unknown> the students to the students who are going to discover the <unknown> <unknown> on the <unknown> .
and then he comes to the question , how could i get the libra <unknown> <unknown> at the nobel prize ?
because he imagine that the bees realize that the bees can understand this in the horizon .
but my anger and gentlemen , in a position , it 's <unknown> .
there 's no idea of a sense of the idea of a sense of the same thing .
and just the professor <unknown> , who was many years in <unknown> university of the university of the people who has been shown in <unknown> , and the bees are using a <unknown> to the <unknown> .
as a <unknown> web of the <unknown> are <unknown> to the <unknown> , and now , with the script , you have a <unknown> principle , and you understand the <unknown> principle , and the bees , the <unknown> , the <unknown> , with their legs
do you see what these bees do ?
it 's <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , and the kids are losing their fear of bees .
so , we 're going to develop a awareness for the bees .
they learn , <unknown> , to figure out what the bees do .
and they get a measure of what these people are just going to live only in humans , and people are alive to us .
the bees ca n't make the script not the mermaid reduction in a zero per million dollars a year .
<unknown> years ago the first opportunity to make toast that harriet of hamburger crimes crimes .
they 're collecting the <unknown> out of the <unknown> outside the trees , and the <unknown> of the trees are <unknown> .
this is a <unknown> , with a <unknown> , with the <unknown> , you put them the people out of the people .
and now imagine you in the summer , which is <unknown> -- <unknown> bees on the ground room , so on bees , so on a <unknown> room , at <unknown> degrees .
hey , there 's a <unknown> <unknown> , and there 's a <unknown> <unknown> without having a end .
no , no , not the way we do n't do , but the bees ca n't do .
because they have in this <unknown> natural bacteria , and they have natural natural facilities .
they collect the pollen , and they 're going to be able to put it in a device , he will be <unknown> him , he 's going to <unknown> a <unknown> , and <unknown> a <unknown> <unknown> .
somebody who 's at the <unknown> , and <unknown> , <unknown> , and can be able to go to a <unknown> today , and you can go through a <unknown> , and make a <unknown> to the <unknown> from the people .
of course , there 's a grid to the surface of the <unknown> and with a <unknown> , and so on , you know , there 's nothing wrong with nothing .
yes , and gentlemen , and gentlemen , the bed of the <unknown> , the wheels of the things that we do n't do is the bees , but we would have less enjoyable , if we ca n't go to the world , or we had to educate the chinese
there 's a lot more about the same time , and there 's much more about the same time , and there 's much more about the data .
look at the <unknown> , there 's the outside of the agrarian oil that 's also the growing extension of the <unknown> , where the cows are <unknown> .
and so the construction curve , the open source is <unknown> , your <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> this <unknown> <unknown> .
and now the cow and the <unknown> and the <unknown> of the <unknown> and only because they can <unknown> them <unknown> , they can <unknown> .
yes ?
and then they <unknown> the <unknown> and we , it 's funny , ah , yes , i 've <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , ah , i can go back to the <unknown> .
and then there 's milk .
that 's the bee .
yes ?
and at the end of the truth , the bee tells us the most powerful most powerful thing that we 've been on the nature of nature .
honey .
i want to leave you to quickly briefly briefly , i 'm going to go back to the moment , <unknown> <unknown> .
my students are all aware of every year , if they build these <unknown> , and the part of the most part of them , they 're going to go together to the schools .
now , i do n't have a <unknown> , and i had a student at mit , and i said , `` i said , in the '50s , i did n't have the <unknown> in the university of <unknown> and i said , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
and then he says , `` well , i 'm a hot <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
i come from <unknown> <unknown> , and i 'm a <unknown> of <unknown> , and i 'm 20 years ago .
and i was for about 20 years in five years , and for years , for two years of <unknown> , and for two years of <unknown> , i was about the thomas <unknown> at thomas <unknown> .
and i 'm sure i 'm not going to do it with a lot of time with the <unknown> , but with the hands can be able to learn it .
<unknown> , yeah , <unknown> , with the head .
and a <unknown> <unknown> was through the <unknown> , <unknown> college , <unknown> college .
and more than half of the mother said , oh , that 's what we want to do .
my students experience a new appreciation and the rise between , in <unknown> , normal and normal people , the <unknown> people will be <unknown> by the bees .
and in fact , they 're going to take a lot and put them and make them comfort , my students and a certain pride of my own , and a certain pride of my own , and a certain pride of my own .
how do you get to the bee ?
the question is wrong .
you need to say , `` you want to say , how do you get the <unknown> of the <unknown> ?
and i think , because there 's the human being , the person who 's the same people who are <unknown> the other people and give him a new <unknown> , and it 's a new <unknown> .
and he says , `` well , '' he begins , `` do we start to do this with the way .
at the end of a little poem of a <unknown> poem of <unknown> <unknown> of <unknown> <unknown> .
the way that the bee would be the sun is the sun through the <unknown> , which is the way that you find the way to the flower , and never put the path to the <unknown> <unknown> , and the <unknown> is the diameter in a <unknown>
thank you very much .
hello , hey , love of all of friends , all of the friends are all of all of the world .
welcome to the presentation of my project .
the project of my person and my wife and my wife .
it 's the struggle for a end of the female <unknown> .
in my eyes , the biggest tribes of humanity , because it was <unknown> for the <unknown> , because it was <unknown> for <unknown> years ago .
the society against the women who are still using the <unknown> of the victims of a half day a day .
i first started to start with first course , first , i think , just like , i think , just as i think , i think , let me introduce it , i think ,
my name is <unknown> , i 'm a resident , i come from enron .
i 've been <unknown> there for a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> for a <unknown> <unknown> .
you can think that you might not feel the way to me , and i think that the one has n't been <unknown> to me .
i did n't feel like it was n't <unknown> .
and i was happy that i was glad to me in the subject of <unknown> and exciting things , and i 've been fascinated by the <unknown> .
for example , this is a way to do that .
with a giant <unknown> <unknown> over the atlantic of africa , brazil from brazil .
and i 'm going to conclude , i 'm going to come up with the <unknown> of the <unknown> , the <unknown> <unknown> , the eradication of genocide before the blogosphere , the genocide of genocide was <unknown> at the last <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , prevent the <unknown> rate , to prevent the <unknown> .
this was a place where i was more <unknown> , and i was more <unknown> than the <unknown> , more <unknown> than <unknown> <unknown> .
and yet , these doctrines are to find the interest of the media and even a little bit of a man 's greatest audience as i could put his life to the world .
<unknown> , i was working with my <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> in ethiopia 's <unknown> <unknown> .
in this time , war between the world trade and the conflict of conflict and conflict , and we were <unknown> the of these shelves there .
and despite all the documents that we saw , we were <unknown> on the other side of the unfortunate <unknown> of the <unknown> that <unknown> us <unknown> <unknown> , the casa da musica <unknown> .
and we 've been able to get back to the past , and we were coming to the two <unknown> , which you see here with your body as a <unknown> , if you 're going to do ,
if you want to kill the killing you want to kill you through ourselves .
i mean , some of the things that i found was in a different culture of unprecedented culture .
and then , in the year , and they 've learned that they 've learned to have cancer , and they 've learned that you ca n't reduce islam , which can not reduce cancer , is based on terrorism , terrorism , terrorism , is also about terrorism .
sometimes christians , people do n't want to be incredibly vulnerable to their terrorism .
for example , the <unknown> <unknown> .
the <unknown> , the <unknown> , the <unknown> , the <unknown> .
but rather , the more detail of the life of the ideas like <unknown> , social responsibility , the <unknown> responsibility , the <unknown> responsibility , the <unknown> responsibility .
these are the values that are worth to fight to fight .
after a few years , i 've been back in this <unknown> , and i 've been back in this <unknown> , i was working on my wife , and with my wife , i was <unknown> , and my wife 's <unknown> .
and we heard of this <unknown> women 's <unknown> <unknown> , and we heard about this <unknown> female <unknown> .
when i heard that <unknown> percent of the everyday victims are the lesters who are christians and christians were n't going to be happy , and how could you be a <unknown> , like what could we be in the <unknown> ?
and the idea was born to have the biggest connection of islam to persuade the privilege of persuading the privilege of encyclopedia , to make the pizza to the sin .
we looked at how to <unknown> with the organizations that we did n't find out .
and so we had to hear us that we would just be able to just get rid of all the time that we should n't have completely <unknown> , which islam did n't even be <unknown> .
you would <unknown> the <unknown> <unknown> .
in <unknown> , <unknown> of international international , we 've been <unknown> our own national organization .
and of course , they were <unknown> out of <unknown> and <unknown> control .
and now , to make sure that battle , we need to put some battle on the way to help us , and we needed to photographs pictures .
and a lack of risk .
and so , <unknown> and <unknown> and i 've got to put into the desert to the desert to make the pictures of my hands .
the bad blob of these things i do n't show you , but i want to be looking at the crime scene .
girl in the age of four weeks , at the end of the parents , and the <unknown> <unknown> , the earth 's orbit you go to the limbs , and to do without the <unknown> and the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> with a <unknown> interdependence , without the <unknown>
what 's going on is the light of the size of a size of a <unknown> .
now , it 's now going to take a <unknown> .
if you 're going to get your rule to you two weeks .
<unknown> <unknown> would be <unknown> on body and soul , so bear , and her , <unknown> of her dignity .
this was the beginning of the <unknown> <unknown> called the <unknown> <unknown> .
in the <unknown> , it goes on , and the way that goes on , and the way it goes on .
the man has to open it up to the second .
he never had a <unknown> woman who saw a woman 's wife , but there 's a woman 's wife .
the <unknown> <unknown> told me , `` oh , <unknown> , is n't a problem .
you put your penis <unknown> , and you put it up in the <unknown> , and then you put them hard to <unknown> .
and if you ca n't do it , it 's not bad .
then you take the stone and <unknown> and <unknown> them on the ground .
this is <unknown> <unknown> .
in a third of the girl , a third of the girl .
you had the same months of three months ago .
shock , the girl had lost his language lost his language .
these are the <unknown> , and the other thing , the other cost , and some of the groups are also a few different places , and so in a few years , we 've got a lot of asia .
most of them are most of the <unknown> .
and when we asked muslims , what we did , why did you do that ?
was the most important thing , the problem is , that must be , that 's the right thing in the koran .
nothing is the koran , in the koran , is the same thing , the contrary .
and so the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> five times a day in the patient , and a certain <unknown> , the <unknown> , the creator , is the perfect language , the <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> .
but they do n't seem to believe what they 're praying for .
they 're called <unknown> , a <unknown> effect on the women 's <unknown> and why we can now think about <unknown> <unknown> , and women <unknown> <unknown> women , women ,
but now we had the images of the first time , we had the images of the first <unknown> , and we had the <unknown> <unknown> of this <unknown> .
he <unknown> us all the <unknown> <unknown> , and all of the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> a <unknown> <unknown> of a conference .
there were hard to have some discussions , two days ago .
but we had the public health on our side , our first <unknown> , the highest <unknown> <unknown> on our side .
and then the great decision , the great decision , the practice is against against human rights , against religion , to religion , we need to use it .
as a recent years , the way that <unknown> <unknown> was this new <unknown> book , which is the new <unknown> project .
and if you have africa and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it 's because it has to be able to have
and it 's a <unknown> and so those who we have also found in the world in other countries .
so , just as a few other , i 'm <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> the fifth , the <unknown> of the country , his life is a crime , writing it .
and then , i was then a teenager , and we took the first day with a <unknown> , and we were able to go through his own <unknown> experience .
we had a hundred hundred hundred <unknown> <unknown> that we 've been doing .
and where we came , we 've only had to pay open ears , open arms and open the surprising holy commandments .
and when we wanted to leave the country at the time , the great scholar and <unknown> <unknown> , and so what you really do all of all the most successful countries i do ?
so much , the more detail , you will not be able to give you more than anybody else .
he 's right .
i 'm a <unknown> , and there 's a little bit of a little bit of it to get slowly slowly and get a little bit of fun to you .
and what he was doing was , he had a idea .
he said that if you 're looking at the fact that the <unknown> <unknown> muslims in the world to get a table , and the idea of the practice to write , you know , the practice of the name , it 's a sin .
and i was , and i flew to the <unknown> in the <unknown> , and i was able to <unknown> the <unknown> , and the <unknown> , and the very <unknown> of the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
and as a <unknown> , for the <unknown> of the right <unknown> , the <unknown> of the <unknown> , his <unknown> professor , <unknown> <unknown> ali shares a <unknown> , and we 've got a <unknown> .
he heard the idea of being thought about being a thought about what we were wasting him , and we would say that he would be able to use that .
so what we do is we do , we do , and we do , we do , we do , and that 's what we do is about the <unknown> that we use to support for ourselves .
and then he said , i 'm not just looking at the conference , and i 'm not going to just hear the conference , and we asked him about this , but i 'm going to take the <unknown> <unknown> .
and so he did .
over the early <unknown> , at least , at the most surprising <unknown> at the first time , the <unknown> <unknown> of our <unknown> <unknown> , our <unknown> <unknown> .
international <unknown> <unknown> the <unknown> of the female body of women 's bodies , by the female body of <unknown> , by the way they were <unknown> .
in the <unknown> , the <unknown> of the <unknown> professor , dr. <unknown> ali ali <unknown> <unknown> .
and everybody all came up .
so , <unknown> <unknown> , but the top of the world .
in the middle of the <unknown> , the guy who has <unknown> , in fact , the guy has <unknown> <unknown> in kabul , and in the rest of europe , he 's the key of the <unknown> of the financial crisis because of the cartoons .
so men have people who are killing people and death are teachers , and save our own .
but the other thing that is also the other thing .
on the left side of the <unknown> , the <unknown> of the <unknown> , the right , the <unknown> of the <unknown> , my favorite ones , the <unknown> , the <unknown> , which is my <unknown> , '' and the <unknown> ,
the highest in the world .
and what i 'm doing is just looking at a moment to me , i 'm only just sitting on a vacuum , and i 'm exercising , and i 'm not very much longer , and i 'm not personally , and i 'm personally personally personally .
and then i put them to warn all of them .
and the beginning started this conference .
and in our spirit of the <unknown> , at the sign of the left of the left of the left of the <unknown> , from egypt , in a <unknown> of nationalism , and then on the left , right now .
the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> age egypt was a <unknown> actor , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> of wife and <unknown> <unknown> , germany , germany .
so much more important , the subject of islam is not <unknown> .
we also had teenagers to give up their own time , which is a lot of times more , which terrible people you would women women with the <unknown> , and the <unknown> .
and then they had some of the <unknown> <unknown> show , <unknown> <unknown> .
reality .
the men had <unknown> eyes .
they went back to the doors of the dalai lama only had two hours , and they had written <unknown> , and they wrote a <unknown> , a <unknown> , a <unknown> ,
the <unknown> <unknown> over the cameras , the <unknown> , what they decided to do .
and the most important sentence in this is a third sentence , which was this one .
female <unknown> is a <unknown> crime that 's worth <unknown> <unknown> against the evidence of the evidence of islam , which is the medical research project .
he <unknown> the <unknown> .
we thought that job is a job , did n't have done the same without the <unknown> without our <unknown> <unknown> .
because the reason to talk about the slightest idea of the woman 's talk , is more than almost the way you think , is that almost the vote .
that 's why we 've been doing this . we 're doing <unknown> .
we have this idea of what we 've been doing is that the experiment in this so-called book book .
a <unknown> for the world of the world 's side of the world .
and because sheikh <unknown> , the <unknown> , that he was so good , it was so good , the book , he has a <unknown> , so that he was a <unknown> .
it 's going to come from us to do the hands of the hands .
we 've been in many countries in many countries , and we 've had to put in the world <unknown> <unknown> to the highest <unknown> <unknown> .
and they 've been working with the very few stories that they were excited to be proud of their stories that they have the book of <unknown> .
but unfortunately , most of the most important , we did n't have the ability to cope with the courage to <unknown> it .
and the <unknown> of the woman 's probably you talk about talking about the phone , you 're not talking about the mosque .
some of the <unknown> has been able to satisfy the courage to be beneficial .
they 're at least at the dawn of the morning , at least in <unknown> , at least <unknown> .
and sometimes we have some other <unknown> <unknown> found that actually actually actually have in the bed of the tumor , and here we have .
and then it goes back to the <unknown> .
and the thing that is the ones that is the ones that 's the ones .
they will spread it .
but the time of this is what i 'm going to do is about it , and i 'm going to have to go out to the time .
it 's all from the <unknown> stones , hot water , and that 's what i work for many other strategies , that <unknown> <unknown> .
the practice of <unknown> .
but my <unknown> <unknown> this is this thing .
i want to tell the great message of the highest <unknown> of the world 's <unknown> on the world of the <unknown> of islam , which is the <unknown> in the kaaba in the kaaba , in the kaaba in l.a .
not the <unknown> <unknown> of <unknown> <unknown> , but in the <unknown> <unknown> , but in the <unknown> , '' in the <unknown> .
so if i have two million people dying together , men and men are <unknown> , women , women and women <unknown> islamic standards , and women are <unknown> islamic laws .
then i 'm going to do with all of the people who are in my blog , and the <unknown> king , and my <unknown> king , and i was a <unknown> of my open up there , and i think , is that they 're standing on the <unknown> , and the <unknown> , please , and the <unknown> , please .
as i 've been talking about it , then , i 've got the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
unfortunately , i was still the last <unknown> , and i was missing the last <unknown> , which was the <unknown> king king .
but i 'm sure if he <unknown> the <unknown> of this , he would be proud of this .
to give you to help to help these women .
for the other way , to show the world , which is the real notion of islam , rather than the beginning of the <unknown> is always possible to show the other way , and then we can go to the viewer , and then we can go back to the way , and then they 're going to be able to do it .
terrorists could <unknown> as simple as <unknown> <unknown> .
if i do n't do this , i would n't use this , i could make this <unknown> , which , i 've been looking at this in a few years ago , and i 've been working on in 1938 .
that if you 're at least many of the <unknown> <unknown> in the telly is all the ones in the world , in the world .
and we can get it into a feeling of the possible .
and maybe i 'd have to think that the little girl who did n't have to do not take his daughters to be more <unknown> , and his children , not too <unknown> .
then life has been tied up to my life completely well that it was so true .
and i want to tell you about anybody who is heard about , or something has been heard about or have to talk to me , i 'm going to talk to me , think about it .
not all of the things that you do n't look at is a <unknown> <unknown> .
we have to have the need to the trend in the diameter , and in the case , i do n't even have any of this stage , except on this stage .
and so i want to leave you the design of my <unknown> , i 've got to show you the design of my <unknown> .
this is my favorite <unknown> , my <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> .
and this is all in all the <unknown> , and in the <unknown> , the <unknown> , and the <unknown> of the <unknown> and <unknown> team has been to always <unknown> .
there is also a german here in the bottom .
female <unknown> is the <unknown> and the koran , and the limitations of islam are incompatible with islam .
it 's <unknown> , and a <unknown> of islam , islam , islam , islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i 'm going to go to the way .
so the <unknown> <unknown> , which was the <unknown> that you had been <unknown> in germany .
at the best part , i think , <unknown> <unknown> , my mother , my brother and i first to see the first time of a <unknown> <unknown> .
it was <unknown> <unknown> .
my mom was completely <unknown> because she did n't understand why they did n't understand why have been calling why we 've got now now eat food .
we went to the third day we 've been touched by the third day , we 've been found out .
we were able to wrestle with the equipment to <unknown> the stuff , a <unknown> woman and <unknown> <unknown> , and <unknown> <unknown> that just <unknown> against <unknown> .
they tried to explain us to say that we can eat food .
this is not <unknown> .
it actually even very well , it sounds very good .
it 's cheese .
my mother moved the beatles to the mast , and we were laughing .
miniaturization .
in my own country , i have n't <unknown> the <unknown> in the workforce , and that 's not what we 're going to do , is n't how we react to be a <unknown> odor .
i 'm a <unknown> <unknown> of <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> , and <unknown> years old .
fourteen years ago i was with my mother and my sister 's china to germany , and i call the `` <unknown> of china to the 47 . ''
so , i 'm going to tell you about this <unknown> dictum that i 'm going to tell you today .
but most of all of this , i 'm going to be about to make the people that they needed to have this to be able to have the <unknown> and have a big success of them .
but first , just kidding , i 'm telling you to see where i 'm exactly right to see where i 'm doing , which i 'm really doing , i 'm really excited about .
i 'm a <unknown> <unknown> .
<unknown> are a little bit of <unknown> that 's in the middle east china , and in the northwest of china , in the northwest of china ,
and this region is called the <unknown> of the <unknown> of the <unknown> area called the <unknown> area called <unknown> .
it 's about 100 miles away germany , and it 's about 12,000 miles away .
in china , there are 10 million people in the u.k. , but in <unknown> , there are the largest <unknown> community of the largest <unknown> community outside china .
and so this <unknown> is so that because here 's because there 's because in india , we 've got in china in china , we have to have in the most <unknown> of the <unknown> .
hundreds of thousands of the year , after all of us , we 've been <unknown> to <unknown> <unknown> by us to have a closer home for a half days .
our own child , <unknown> <unknown> was made out of the education system of <unknown> education .
in schools , in the same way , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the way , we 're only going to hire people who are only a private food systems .
and our religion , we ca n't even be free to act on a way to make sure that we can also be free free .
the <unknown> are all their own way to make their culture and build identity and so identity .
and if someone 's bold , and if you 're a terrible and <unknown> of the <unknown> , <unknown> , often , <unknown> , even though , death .
that was also , my parents , who told you that i was invited to pray to people , to teach kids .
this was <unknown> , and i was a writer , and i was 11 years old years old .
the photo is just about our perspective at a <unknown> pace .
we did n't have enough money , so we had to just dad and dad had to just quit my father back there .
i 'm talking to me , many people who were doing a lot of people who have helped us to have a <unknown> .
i 'm going to make a lot of my images .
i 'm <unknown> to <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> on our <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
i was just watching this in my mind , and when i mean my <unknown> <unknown> .
he was big , <unknown> had <unknown> , and we were then we used him with his little <unknown> with his little <unknown> on a parking lot of a parking lot .
the first thing that was <unknown> was the first <unknown> .
i know that many of a <unknown> picture of <unknown> have that you may want to do business , and do n't want to be interested in the 2020s , not for the betterment of the fittest .
but i 'm going to say , `` i 'm going to say , `` i call the <unknown> '' and i call the <unknown> ' <unknown> , not as a <unknown> .
because <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> us all night .
he was at the airport in <unknown> on a <unknown> , and it was to the last end of the <unknown> , and if we really were really <unknown> by the <unknown> .
airport in the <unknown> , we got to come and i know how to mother , i told you , i was asked to go out of a <unknown> .
you ca n't stand up to you .
until we are out there , until we are out there , until we are out there , until we 're out there , until we have outside of the city .
because i had a look at my hand , and there was also a picture of the <unknown> , but i was a very <unknown> name , because <unknown> was a <unknown> name , <unknown> .
i had to be a <unknown> <unknown> by the <unknown> <unknown> .
and i 'm <unknown> to my <unknown> <unknown> , who he was he met with my shoes ' son , and i had my hand in my hand .
silence .
<unknown> health .
a long look at a long time .
we finally have been <unknown> <unknown> .
in <unknown> , i was thinking about a lot of <unknown> <unknown> who were taught to many of us who have been doing a lot of fuss .
i was just looking for the <unknown> woman who was used to <unknown> with <unknown> , and i 've been used to <unknown> for the <unknown> .
in a <unknown> of a <unknown> with four <unknown> per gallon , a family 's former families .
at least , now , at least , now , at least , now , at least , children now have children at least children .
a <unknown> and a kitchen , and a kitchen , and one of the kitchen .
there were strangers faces .
and many different languages .
and we had no privacy .
my mom , my brother and i had to share a <unknown> part of it .
there was a <unknown> , she was forced to impress and she did n't have homework and homework .
friends were n't going to be <unknown> to me because i was <unknown> where we were doing , where we were doing , where we were doing , where we were doing , where we were doing , we were able to <unknown> .
just my <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> <unknown> in the <unknown> knew that it was very difficult .
she knew my story and i was allowed me and i was very interested in , and she was working on me , and she was about to me .
for example , i took me to <unknown> me what i 'm doing is a little bit more about what i do n't do more than i do n't do more .
but also , it also helped me to find a lot of time , german <unknown> argued .
i spent my life in the <unknown> <unknown> .
it was n't just a good way to do not my best .
in the way , with our parents without their husband and always in the uncertainty , because we just had only a <unknown> , and could have been <unknown> , and could n't get <unknown> ,
i 'm sure to me , i was very pleased to me , i was very , very awkward , high , i was very , very awkward , and i was a <unknown> , and i was a kid .
it 's also too pleased to tell you all of this here , now , but now i just have to be honest to my story .
i was very aggressive , and i was very pleased to focus on a high school , and i was able to focus a lot bad to work in school , and i was doing a lot of time in school .
and we took the way we 've been doing so far to the <unknown> <unknown> , where we were looking at the <unknown> of the kids who were living with a children in touch .
i 'm thinking about how to me , i do n't know what i had to do n't work to be a <unknown> living in a <unknown> , which i had to be in a <unknown> .
i also <unknown> myself to the <unknown> of me that i would and i have my brother to <unknown> or <unknown> <unknown> .
we 're just going to take a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit of the one .
i also also put in a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , and i was able to have a homework <unknown> that i did was to do with me , because our parents did n't have a german war .
or the simple thing that we just did with us , and we just took out to us .
we always had very excited .
i know that there was always like we were getting out there on the fence and waited until these people came up because they were going to be people for us , and that was a really important thing for us .
after two years after , my father came to germany , germany came to germany .
but the problem was , he 's called <unknown> to <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> because there 's no longer <unknown> in the <unknown> , because there 's no longer more susceptible to him .
i was making my work , very talented writing that i 've been doing to my father 's point to china to the <unknown> of the <unknown> , and then we had to put it in <unknown> to the <unknown>
i 'm going to go to the time where i really have been , very happy because it 's only six years ago , we 've got to get into a normal place .
we got a <unknown> for three years , and we 've got a whole apartment working with a very small flower with a very small forehead and a different boat , and a different boat .
and even even i had a room . i had a room .
it was very small , and i did n't have a desk in a while , but it was good , but it was good , i could do my door to the <unknown> .
and i 'm just saying that i was doing the time , very good , but i had to go to the <unknown> without a <unknown> without a meeting without a meeting .
i never really have no interest in my mind .
and so , a <unknown> that has been <unknown> me in the <unknown> , and it still has been to be a little bit about the idea that i can <unknown> across the second , and i can also see it in the second <unknown> .
first , we 've got the first time to start with the <unknown> , and then we 've got the <unknown> <unknown> , and i think ,
i thank the teacher who really believed in my parents and i was n't really just just just just time to only time to go to the time , and i even had to turn it to the <unknown> .
and then i came to the <unknown> , and i came to the <unknown> , and i came to the <unknown> .
and before i was the <unknown> , i was a <unknown> , and i was able to finish up with my best friend , and i was <unknown> my favorite friends in <unknown> .
<unknown> is a organization or a national engineer , a project or a project of the organized <unknown> , which is a project called <unknown> , which is a project called <unknown> .
but i was n't a good <unknown> of the <unknown> , because i was just because i was very <unknown> because we had a place where we had a place where we could go .
we had a <unknown> that we had to put our <unknown> test , which we could put our <unknown> <unknown> .
and the bbc of <unknown> helped us feel that we could tell our problems that he could tell him , and he managed to help us , and we could also make ourselves all sorts of things , and we were trying to make ourselves a lot of <unknown> .
and then i came to the <unknown> , and then i was <unknown> , <unknown> , i 've been <unknown> .
and this is a project where people young people without a meeting of a meeting , he <unknown> the <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> .
and i really made me very good , and i found a lot of art , which is something that i think , is something that i 'm looking at me , and so i was doing some more <unknown> .
by <unknown> and <unknown> , a <unknown> was a <unknown> of us , and a filmmaker from us .
he made the film <unknown> over the film of the friends of my friends and me .
and the film was a lot of <unknown> a lot of prices .
we realized that the people were interested in our story .
he was a very special feeling , because we had n't been able to have any experienced that people had given us who had heard us .
and that was so a moment where i thought , okay , so on this moment .
i do n't want to get more <unknown> .
i want to do something like my life .
a <unknown> of <unknown> , a <unknown> of chicago led me to the idea of my idea for a <unknown> to the <unknown> of a <unknown> of the <unknown> <unknown> , and i was trying to leave the <unknown> of the <unknown> <unknown> to the <unknown> .
but i 've been able to put my <unknown> into the <unknown> , i got to a <unknown> in a <unknown> , and i was a <unknown> for a piece of a <unknown> , and the title is a <unknown> .
so i was very right here right .
i was playing with it .
and the great thing is that the great two is a few two <unknown> <unknown> from the <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> <unknown> on me , and i 'm <unknown> <unknown> .
and i had to help me think of myself , i would have been interested in my own personal <unknown> .
i thought , was a good thing , great , great , <unknown> <unknown> .
now , i think , well , i can do with you .
and i made it for the <unknown> <unknown> , and so <unknown> <unknown> , and a member of my <unknown> , and a friend of a <unknown> , i was also working on a european <unknown>
and i also hired it to be able to won it , and i also hired it .
now , i 've been thinking of the school for the school for the <unknown> for film and film <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> on the third year and the <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> .
and it would n't be possible to me without any one or a <unknown> like the <unknown> or projects like <unknown> , were good for me to me , and so forth like me .
they 've been feeling that i 've made me on me and i have shown to try to make a little bit more ways that i can actually find my place where i can actually find my place in a society where i 'm going to do with
and so i come to you to leave you now .
every one of them has given the possibility of how to give a second chance to get your life and find life and find their place in society .
because , the people , the one hand , <unknown> are going to a hundred acres of refugees , and every one of them are full of hope and each one of them has a big potential .
they have done it for many of these calibrated to make lots of awful motives <unknown> behind them .
and with this trait , they could actually be large amounts of land for germany and for every single one of us , and for every single one of us .
and i could actually tell you a lot of things that you can do , but i do n't have more time , even though there is a minute , i 've been hearing about a <unknown> .
now you 're now <unknown> your cell phone out of you , and you ca n't tell me that you ca n't need a code of the code .
occasionally you can download the code , and then you get them to the side of <unknown> <unknown> with many of the <unknown> , which you can do with you , so you can do .
and that would help us help us all of us .
i 've always been doing for a moment to imagine now , and i 'm going to remember that engagement and we 'll see ourselves , and we look at hopefully ourselves , and i see ourselves , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully
and sign you compare the code .
i was the same thing .
many people have not the ability to make the cell phone in the hand .
you 've been so excited about , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
yes , yeah .
it just led to just a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
so , i 'm going to give you that we 're going to make it .

and that 's what i 'm going to do right now here is now on here .

i start with a joke .
and two of these <unknown> are <unknown> both sides .
so , this is , like , you know , are two words , i would n't get <unknown> , and i 'm not going to do it all the time , but you know , i 've been doing something that i 've been doing something that i 've been doing , i 've been doing something that i 've been doing and <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , and <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> in <unknown> .
`` the other ones '' yes , '' to be , `` if other things have happened .
and <unknown> <unknown> ca n't do the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
we 'd put the <unknown> .
the first text is a little bit of a <unknown> camera that i wrote a lot of <unknown> , which i 've talked about .
i 've been doing it for a point that was a person who was told me what 's called <unknown> , which means that what 's been .
it 's titled called the title `` <unknown> <unknown> . ''
and yet , it did n't understand it , and it did n't understand it , and at the time , it did n't understand it .
when your head in my lap was the rest of my fingers under my ceiling , and i 'd look at the rest of my feet .
my leg was also under my dog 's <unknown> on the ceiling was the leg was outside the leg outside outside the ceiling .
my leg was a <unknown> , and he was <unknown> through the ceiling , and i was walking around the ceiling .
it 's your head of being able to be able to go to my lap , which is the rest of your ceiling , and the leg under the ceiling was under the ceiling , her leg outside outside the ceiling .
this has been <unknown> , which is , as a result of a dog extremely successful .

and then the next text i 've been able to give you a time that i was doing a person who is really a lot of means that i 'm really a lot of means that i 'm really doing something that means me .
and my <unknown> <unknown> .
we have n't have a <unknown> anymore , and we have no longer anymore .

yes , there were a big text text text .
better do n't do better .
jesus is the only way of the <unknown> sits on the <unknown> <unknown> of the kitchen , the <unknown> of the kitchen 's office .
but where jesus was he when i should be told me to save this before `` <unknown> '' should save save me from the <unknown> ?
so , think about it , yes ?
i 've been <unknown> my <unknown> out of the <unknown> ?
next text text .
the next text is a little longer a little bit more longer than a little bit more .
it 's actually going to be a company to a number of hours .
so , writing .
reading about this is getting faster , faster ?
is the beginning of a novel that i 'm going to do with the novel that i 'm going to do with the <unknown> <unknown> , '' which i 'm going to do with the <unknown> <unknown> .
ah , it 's about <unknown> guys , so the adventure from one guy who goes back to the hair and then <unknown> a little bit of a little bit more fast .
i 'm always going to be able to say that i 'm sure that i 'm sure to think about this place because i 'm sure that i 'm going to distance even the basis of the <unknown> , i 'm passing away from the time .
because i never had no <unknown> to me , `` i never know the hair , '' i 've never been able to put the hair up .
chapter one was a one .
when i 'm <unknown> , i will get a <unknown> , i 'll get a <unknown> empty .
so in fact , what the animations that is , you 've got to try and get to a while that 's trying to fill it up in a way .
yes , i 'm not going to come out of the day .
very hard one of a year of hours of a year , a thousand years ago .
the next text is also a little bit of a <unknown> <unknown> .
most people do n't understand it .
i 'm just trying to do it for myself .
and that 's what i like to love with play with my vocabulary and my neighbors , as my language .
i always wanted to love myself to me with me , and i was playing with me , and i was playing with me .
and yeah , then you get out of these things .
it 's called the title `` <unknown> <unknown> . ''
it 's a little strange situation , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> .
it may be the <unknown> <unknown> that i 've ever wrote .
so , what we can do is we can do .
we 're <unknown> , we 're <unknown> .
we can all be able to do that , we can all be able to do that all the way we can do .
we <unknown> .
i 'm not really about the most controversial .
but i can .
i can thank you .
i do n't mean , do n't do it .
yes , i did n't understand it .
no idea .
yes , yeah , yes , me , <unknown> me to me .
i always say , you know , either , either , or no , no , no one or no one .
the next piece of thing has also to do with the way that we 've got to do with text .
is somehow a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a small <unknown> machine .
i wrote the term for insects .
very careful .
yes , there are a lot of text text text .
it 's a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a <unknown> .
and so , in fact , it 's cool to be very good at the time , and i 'm going to say , you might say , you might say , you might say , you might say , you might say , you might say , you might say , you might say , you might say , you might say , you might say , you might say , you might say , you might say
my text has the title , which is good , good good things are cool .
so <unknown> <unknown> is <unknown> , so <unknown> <unknown> is <unknown> .
<unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
so , you know , you know , you know , <unknown> , <unknown> and <unknown> and then , and then the whole thing is better and yes , it 's better .
beautiful of the research is very interesting today .
yes , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , who 's a different person .
and it 's very good to do that , if i could do that , we could make all these kind of <unknown> , to make all of these <unknown> , so we try to make all of this .
exactly , exactly what that means is the thing that means that the <unknown> power would be .
the lyrics is the <unknown> and the right thing is going to be the way that comes out of the right .
yes .
power fun with fun .
the <unknown> text is just just a sentence .
i love to play so that little bit as i like to <unknown> small <unknown> .
this is a <unknown> disorder that 's a <unknown> criminal bond .
copyright is called `` <unknown> versus martin s . ''
<unknown> s ?
yes , yeah .
power fun with you .
yes , a recent time ago , there was a final example of a sentence sentence .
this is what 's written in <unknown> .
a long project is a sentence sentence .
i think it almost almost impossible to explain , in order to explain , i 'm sure to explain the <unknown> in the <unknown> , that 's the point .
here , another one , i 've got a text .
this day is a <unknown> . this is a <unknown> <unknown> .
is the title of text from the text .
this day is a <unknown> , and a day , and he knows it . he knows it .
he 's got it to remember before i was able to put it back to this as a <unknown> <unknown> .
he gave me a <unknown> <unknown> , and he gave me a <unknown> , and he would take me to me , and he would take me off the <unknown> .
i can hardly even leave myself later in him later , i could n't get myself back to him , and i can say , i 'm going to be <unknown> .
i was doing the passion .
it was like him as a <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> allen all night days and <unknown> me back to the night and night me .
with a <unknown> <unknown> in the face of where the sun is going to happen , if else ?
and intent is n't to make it more than i was using a little bit of a <unknown> by looking at the <unknown> , and i 'm going to be <unknown> .
and i should be giving back back up later , i could n't wake up the <unknown> day to a <unknown> day .
now hope , right ?
now it 's time for a little joke , a good joke .
what was henry albert einstein when he was n't liked to marry their steak ?
i <unknown> .
so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so that 's how this is how we do .
letter <unknown> sounds like how cow sounds like the cow .
so that 's funny .
yes , the next text has also been able to learn the paper that came out to be writing paper .
it 's rather what we know , is what 's political .
so , i do n't write nothing to do anything with something that 's not doing fun .
i also think about , it 's partly important to the most important things that we think about , really , really political things .
and i 'm going to play a lot of myself , where i 'm often going to talk to where i 'm going to be a <unknown> .
and , i said , there 's a reason that i wrote written by text text .
he <unknown> the title `` <unknown> <unknown> . ''
my father came out of teens , and in my mother and i went from her mother and i came to her .
yes .
if we would have the <unknown> .
thank you very much for the sound of the sound .
yes , i 'm going to make a sense of that i 'm going to make a little bit of advertising .
i ca n't afford to do a <unknown> or so , so , so , so i must do that , and so i must do that , and i must do that , i must do that to become more <unknown> .
and i was able to do that , i 've been able to do , and i 've also been able to do , and i 've been able to do , and i 've also <unknown> myself , and i also had a <unknown> of <unknown> , and i also had a <unknown> <unknown> in a <unknown> in a <unknown> in vienna .
so , like , you like to start with it .
and i 'm <unknown> , i 'm <unknown> , i 'm <unknown> , i 'm actually <unknown> , i 'm <unknown> , i 'm actually <unknown> , i mean , really <unknown> , i 'm actually <unknown> , i mean , really <unknown> .
and yes , yeah .
i want to tell you that i was going to say to me .
it 's going on on the program .
more <unknown> , which is more advertising .
this is a little piece of play that i wrote for .
feet .
rich is vitamin c .
so the <unknown> thing .
vitamin <unknown> <unknown> .
so , very fun , it 's funny , too funny .
i want to give you a joke about the <unknown> of your friend , but the computer was just a <unknown> , but the <unknown> was just a firefighter , but it was just a flat axis .
yes , it 's not a <unknown> , i 'm not just my <unknown> <unknown> .
<unknown> <unknown> on the head of <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> to me , and she <unknown> the <unknown> of the <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> .
yes .
thank you for listening to anyone .
you 've got great news .
thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .
let me start looking at a question of thinking about a <unknown> question .
why do you do it to help <unknown> on this ?
i think everybody who would be able to be able to be able to help teachers , asking for the money , if he can only talk to a moment of opportunity , and then we can give back to the opportunity to make a more positive society .
the answer is clear clear .
we now know that the life expectancy is about the only of the birth of the birth percent of <unknown> 's <unknown> .
that means something that has to have any dynamic , <unknown> <unknown> , have the chance to have the impact on the ground .
why do n't know why ? we know that we know that little bit ?
why are we going to get from the <unknown> news from the <unknown> that <unknown> itself to the rest of each other ?
and you remember that , you know , they 'd all seen the last year , and they remember that the <unknown> was a thought of <unknown> , and then he realized there were a lot of fuss .
it was fat .
you thought , if you were fat from your food , you 're going to get rid of the nest and you 're going to be healthy , and it 's healthy old .
what 's the <unknown> of <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> was a different <unknown> in american es and what nothing changed is that the americans lost a year category .
then you said , `` oh , no , no , no .
but not the fat .
it 's the islamists .
what then then you 're doing , like the <unknown> <unknown> like the <unknown> of the <unknown> , the <unknown> and the led to <unknown> , and so on the way that we 've done .
so it 's going to be more and more new <unknown> , and then we 're going to be a new <unknown> <unknown> through the village , <unknown> , and it 's a <unknown> .
how do the whole <unknown> ?
now , the reason is , for my integrity , for my integrity , that we 're going to have <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> technology for scientific research .
in a moment , in a moment of a <unknown> , for example , a <unknown> is <unknown> , which is <unknown> , and here 's a <unknown> place here .
the data that you see is all about .
<unknown> <unknown> a <unknown> <unknown> a new <unknown> magazine show a new <unknown> <unknown> .
the top of the top of the <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> for the <unknown> year for the year , which year .
keith i was seven years old years long ago , and after the long time , for a long time , after long , after long , back to the late end of the back .
then the <unknown> .
now , this lady here .
jean <unknown> <unknown> .
the oldest person who have lived in the biblical who have lived in the earth , and it 's the same time .
<unknown> years ago , they 've been growing up in a long time for a year .
i know there are people who are you to say you 're going to be six , you 're six , but you do n't want to find your <unknown> .
jean <unknown> <unknown> actually actually become <unknown> <unknown> actually <unknown> <unknown> .
and they heard about <unknown> <unknown> , and with <unknown> <unknown> again , then , then , to <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> to the <unknown> of the treatment of the criminals and stop smoking .
and then , when they were dying , they died , they were dying .
what does this tell us ? what 's going to tell us ?
not that brazil are healthy .
it 's told us that it 's very complicated , and that we need to be <unknown> statistics , we need to make simple conflicts systems , and we have to be simple questions .
so , really , really simple questions , and a simple question of simple things that are in the same amount of things that you 're in different countries , there are women everywhere , women are older than men .
what is it true ?
we now know it now .
so , it 's also the testosterone of testosterone , which is produced in the male <unknown> .
and there are <unknown> <unknown> of the very fundamental evidence for the men who are <unknown> as well as women .
now , every person can be thinking about whether or the idea is a <unknown> <unknown> , is a <unknown> <unknown> ,
austria is a <unknown> country .
but there 's still a little bit less here , no fear .
we 're just going to try to do <unknown> ourselves , we 're going to double-click out us to mimic the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
sounds complicated with complicated , but it 's just easy to illustrate a good game of <unknown> .
so , it 's a <unknown> <unknown> , and what happens when you put in a different way of what it was different from different , and look like that they were going to be so old ?
ah .
grandma <unknown> spends a single half acres of the day of a day .
that 's probably the secret of her , right ?
and yet , if you did n't have the course of the 1990s , maybe not only <unknown> <unknown> .
or , you have <unknown> and <unknown> , who would be <unknown> at the ten farmer , more than they were going to be older than the other police .
even intelligent statistics are n't always <unknown> , are always always <unknown> .
for example , for example , in a way , for the hard words , that shows that people who are <unknown> to the <unknown> in the <unknown> , and they 're going to do that , and people do n't do that .
especially .
is <unknown> .
is that the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> ?
no .
it 's because people are just enough money in the pocket and just to make their care and their <unknown> diseases .
but if i have a group of <unknown> <unknown> , to give a <unknown> , and those of the billions of people are dying for us as they were n't going to be the <unknown> , but otherwise , just as i was probably going to be able to get a <unknown> factor in the food industry .
and actually , these events have been done done .
you need to say , `` the <unknown> is the <unknown> , but i 'm always going to be my life with my enemies , that <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> people <unknown> life .
and this is working in the very different organisms .
for example , bacteria is bacteria .
so you see here in the <unknown> of the biodiversity of bacteria , and bacteria are skillful .
if we were <unknown> , in the <unknown> , the <unknown> line , there 's shown in the <unknown> line that have been completely changed as a difference .
the same thing about <unknown> , <unknown> flies and designer was just a month ago about two years ago in the united states that it 's actually been <unknown> for monkeys .
it 's not to be a way to be thin , too , this is n't too strong .
it also works , <unknown> <unknown> at the <unknown> of the <unknown> kitchen .
and this is another experiment where the <unknown> was made in the united states .
what has you done ?
you 've been <unknown> with <unknown> , and have a <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , where you have a lot of <unknown> <unknown> here and night , and then they have
and the way that means that the mice are made thick , and they have sick and have been <unknown> very bad <unknown> <unknown> and bad <unknown> <unknown> .
now , you 've been <unknown> design <unknown> , and they 've been doing this , and they 've been <unknown> the exact same number of <unknown> <unknown> just <unknown> that they were <unknown> .
they did n't need to eat anything without that , because they were going to sell a lot of time to buy twice as much as they were like a thousand months ago .
and these <unknown> <unknown> is <unknown> and healthy and it 's also been <unknown> and it has no longer a <unknown> problem .
so , despite both of these <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> were used to be <unknown> .
both both are many more much more than many more finely .
a sick and the <unknown> and the other healthy .
what 's the thing that actually happened ?
it 's going to be a process called <unknown> <unknown> or a <unknown> , and it 's a <unknown> on the ground .
whenever they 're using organisms or cells , then the next food is going to start to the <unknown> , <unknown> ingredients to <unknown> <unknown> , or <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> to make it open .
that makes sense .
and this looks like this .
you can see how to the <unknown> of the body as well , but also , to <unknown> the <unknown> , which is more like the <unknown> , which is while during the age of the <unknown> .
the <unknown> <unknown> , the <unknown> will be <unknown> , and the blood pressure will be <unknown> and the cell as a <unknown> , and then to cell , you can move to a more than a <unknown> .
and so they 're going to have the <unknown> of the <unknown> in the ancient <unknown> in the ancient way .
that 's the <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> , or the <unknown> of the <unknown> , or the <unknown> of the <unknown> <unknown> often often shares stories .
so , to paraphrase <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> life lives in various organisms .
and it probably probably is , you know , is that the work is working on people .
and we learn that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you 're not going to be able to find out in the <unknown> of any <unknown> <unknown> every day of saving kids , 20 years ago ,
no .
but you 're saying , you know , if you 're hungry , ah , maybe you 'll just be able to go to the <unknown> , the will just turn the <unknown> shot .
listen your job as a diplomat .
and that makes sense of sense of behavior .
when <unknown> 's nine percent of the human beings have what if it has done what if he had to fight , when he had hungry ?
right , he went to the end of the <unknown> .
we 're going to go to the <unknown> , if we 're going to be <unknown> , if we have hunger hungry for us , we have hunger .
and that 's safe to the biology .
now , of course , we know , and that 's what 's happened in the bible , in <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , the mind is ready , but the meat is weak .
the platform is looking for us to imagine a different way of us for ourselves all sorts of things that we 're doing .
so there 's a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> in a <unknown> neighborhood , which showed you a <unknown> trip .
the three <unknown> here here are all about the <unknown> , the dollar the day , we have to take care of the whole day , we can also need to help , and so on , you can also do it again .
and that 's kind of like the real <unknown> .
so we 've done that the way we did for the model of looking for using the molecular greek response to the <unknown> <unknown> despite the organism as though , as a organism , '' the organism eats .
that could be interesting for people that might be <unknown> , because of the <unknown> , not just <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
and it may perhaps even possible that we could imagine that we could imagine that we could help us just imagine a single <unknown> of the life of life , and so it could be <unknown> with life .
so the question is , can we can get the <unknown> , the <unknown> , the <unknown> , the <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , even though you eat ?
and we have many hundred companies to spend three companies to go down , and the <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> .
we 've actually had a found that actually has found a <unknown> , which means `` <unknown> , '' which is <unknown> .
<unknown> is a substance which is being in all of these organisms , but also in the other , and it 's going to be less in all kinds of times as much more than all of the organisms , and then on the other hand , and then on the other hand ,
in the skin , it 's the same thing as the <unknown> .
<unknown> people have been a huge amount of <unknown> in the skin than the <unknown> <unknown> , as a <unknown> , as a <unknown> , and the other thing that they have .
and if we give them a little bit more to human cells , for example , i see this .
this is a <unknown> , which is <unknown> , cell phone is <unknown> cell .
is the <unknown> , the lxd we give <unknown> on it , and we see a lot of thousands of these little <unknown> in the cell , which are the <unknown> that 's the <unknown> <unknown> , the <unknown> , <unknown> .
<unknown> cells cells would look like exactly what they 're looking at exactly like this .
and this work works in different organisms .
so , for example , here 's shown in a <unknown> .
so we have <unknown> substance , which is the <unknown> substance of <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
because the other thing that organisms do is more people , more organisms , as they 're still more than they were doing .
and the answer is that you 're now seeing the typical of the typical of the typical <unknown> of the <unknown> <unknown> .
it 's simple to <unknown> <unknown> .
for example , there 's all of the days of all of days , all of the time , all of the time , after all , every half days , about 300 million years is about half of their homes .
whenever we give birth to the water , there are some parts of the water , and they 're going to be willing to get the ones that are older and more weapons , and they 're better faster than survive better than better better than better better than better better than better better than better .
we know , human cells we 've got from <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> in the world today , and we spend twice as much as long as we go to <unknown>
and the latest recent research also also <unknown> close to itself , that only is the whole thing that all of the knowledge of being <unknown> is being <unknown> by <unknown> , is that it 's <unknown> .
and not only is that life is not just the <unknown> , and it 's also the <unknown> <unknown> .
these <unknown> are clearly <unknown> <unknown> .
so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so
now , you know , of course , you want to know where you know where the <unknown> of the <unknown> is done ?
as the name is , if you said that , if it 's discovered in the sperm , it 's going to be very high in the high seas .
but i can also get them to the <unknown> , and in the <unknown> green <unknown> , and a product of <unknown> <unknown> , which is <unknown> <unknown> in japan , which is so <unknown> <unknown> <unknown>
we then said , `` if hawken '' should be used to use the <unknown> , and how does it possibly treat the <unknown> ?
you know , you have to know that the common favorite of the diseases of education is that while the <unknown> <unknown> is the same <unknown> <unknown> in the brain ,
we 've done experiments , and we 've been <unknown> experiments .
they 're wondering , we 're asked to what we did is we made it in common cells , and we 've made the <unknown> objects .
so , if you 're a more <unknown> if you 're going to be old , if you 're old .
they have more <unknown> in the brain , if they 're going to be a look at the brain , if they 're going to be old .
and the molecular mechanisms that are <unknown> with the presence of memory is actually similar to the people , and it 's like , as people , as people .
now you 're also asking yourself how good that someone has been <unknown> the memory of the fruit of fruit flies ?
this is the experiment where we 're involved in mozambique , and we 've been working together with incredible <unknown> from the university of amsterdam , and we 've got to have <unknown> <unknown> .
they take a hundred and faster , and then they can give you a <unknown> where you 're going to give you a <unknown> that you love .
<unknown> .
and let 's put it in this <unknown> <unknown> .
and then they take the same way , they 're going to be in the next deep and give you to give you a <unknown> , and give you a <unknown> of their ears that they love to do is <unknown> .
we 're going to make them feel the <unknown> of the <unknown> , while we 're <unknown> , but they 're <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
larry <unknown> .
then they take the same flying , they 're going to be able to go to the same thing , the ones in the way , and they 're going to be here in the way .
so , you 're going to take a wave of the <unknown> here , and you can see it , look at the top .
and if you 're there , you 're still from the bottom of the one , and give you a <unknown> and <unknown> of other side of the <unknown> .
where do all you go to the life ?
sure .
and the <unknown> thing is , you know , <unknown> .
except the two here is , we 're going to be here .
these are the <unknown> .
or , let 's say , you say the character .
i love my <unknown> <unknown> , and i do n't really like to <unknown> me to the <unknown> of the <unknown> reward .
okay .
but the <unknown> form of the body that is <unknown> with the age of the same .
not only on flying .
and we actually actually had the <unknown> of the <unknown> of the flying together by <unknown> on a <unknown> , to make a <unknown> , take a <unknown> , and then go back to the other .
and the <unknown> that were in the brain , they were in the brain , they were , again , <unknown> .
that means that <unknown> is not just about the <unknown> , but it 's not just about the <unknown> , but also against the economic diseases , maybe it could be able to quantify cancer diseases , maybe some <unknown> .
and that 's important , because we do n't want to be the <unknown> of the <unknown> <unknown> to the most successful dependence on the creator of the european bullet .
it does n't make sense to make time to <unknown> time <unknown> time .
and i do n't want to give you a little bit of no time to give you a few basic tips to allow us to stay younger .
even more <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> .
it 's not about being able to cure it , or it 's because it 's raining if it 's obstacles , so that 's how it turns out it , or so on it .
there 's also been in a <unknown> group , in cleveland , <unknown> people who had a day ♪ and a day , and no longer no harm !
this is the <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> under the <unknown> of <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
and that 's true that , it 's true , so that 's true , so that 's true , so that 's very good , very good .
that means , it 's <unknown> .
<unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
it 's not really smart , rather than seemingly intelligent carbs seem to be dangerous .
it 's really about the <unknown> .
you know that there are people who are <unknown> <unknown> , where are we used to change diabetes , even if they 're insurgents .
and you also know that sugar can also be able to reduce the growth by tumors , and so that 's the way that it can be <unknown> .
here you see here in the <unknown> <unknown> that are <unknown> <unknown> across the democratic translator , as long as the <unknown> , as you 're doing it ,
after 30 days , all of the days are all of the dead .
very low doses of <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> from the other people , and <unknown> out of glucose rich .
to make a <unknown> effect of power .
there 's only one example , that 's something that 's working in almost all of the organisms , so much as it as well .
eat food and vegetables , vegetables , vegetables .
so , to get the decision of too much , <unknown> to a <unknown> or a <unknown> , and for <unknown> , and <unknown> .
now you know that you know that you know that you can know that <unknown> can be able to do it , and <unknown> people can blur a <unknown> .
this is not under danger in vitamin d .
we 're a <unknown> of a <unknown> , and in the winter of the <unknown> , because vitamin d d is used by sunlight on sunlight on the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the skin .
some of you may not at least three three times per week , a half years ago , that 's a little bit of a <unknown> .
swimming despite the <unknown> <unknown> , many of the <unknown> <unknown> examples of the cost of 10 minutes , they spend 10 percent to 15 years .
now , in fact , in the case of the <unknown> , sometimes the <unknown> <unknown> sometimes had been <unknown> in the <unknown> , and the <unknown> was a quiet time .
the impact of disability and blood pressure on the life expectancy is going on the life expectancy , is created by the way to start with it .
because the monks of life is almost almost as good as women as women are .
<unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , living longer as a <unknown> , more than a <unknown> , as a <unknown> .
<unknown> life longer longer than more than the <unknown> .
but <unknown> life still longer longer as long as <unknown> life .
only <unknown> <unknown> died as much as the dying time when they were dying at <unknown> <unknown> times more than <unknown> .
what is this true ?
people find that what makes you do to do with a whole bunch of things like to do with a <unknown> ,
no , no , no , it 's very easy to be easy .
if there 's a <unknown> <unknown> on the window , i 'm going to call <unknown> <unknown> , and i 'm going to take a <unknown> solution to the <unknown> .
what 's interesting about what 's interesting about this is in some of the <unknown> sites .
<unknown> acts , <unknown> and what it is used to be used by less than under the other people , and <unknown> , and so on the other hand , and so on the other hand ,
so , apparently , it has to be difficult for anything , but it 's difficult to make sense of <unknown> effects .
a cooperative partner and a family family or a family family is <unknown> with the new way .
they do n't want to get a lot of living in a much more crimes road .
now , you think , you think , you think , you think , you think , you think , you think , you think , you think , you think , you think , you think , you think , you think , you think , you think , you think , you think , you think , you think , you think , you think , you think , you think , you think , you think
but that does n't have nothing to do with nothing to do with nothing with nothing to do with <unknown> .
it 's about <unknown> .
you can measure the closer every little bit of a bit of a place in a much more <unknown> street , which is more than <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , he 's in the blood .
and the other thing , he said , `` i said , i was too used to be obsessed with it .
i can never do anything sleep and the noise does n't really do anything . ''
it 's not true .
he even more <unknown> in the blood and the <unknown> is that , and it 's bad .
sunlight should be <unknown> by the information system of <unknown> , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course
we now know that we 've been doing that that <unknown> has very good relative effects of extraordinary effects .
it 's all uva , it can increase the <unknown> reduction in the <unknown> , and it 's <unknown> the <unknown> .
and we also know that knowledge and choices that are <unknown> to <unknown> <unknown> .
and so what we did was , in fact , the way that we knew ourselves , is , the way that we 've been doing is , again , we 've been able to do with the course of the <unknown> and so on the <unknown> , and so on the surface of the time , and so on the surface of the time , and so on the surface of the time .
does n't matter without ourselves .
several studies that tides that the chocolate chocolate on the <unknown> chocolate are going to be <unknown> , and <unknown> can be <unknown> .
now recently , a beautiful study of <unknown> that showed that the <unknown> of the glass of a girl 's a little mile automobile meter per day , and a <unknown> can show you a <unknown> of a <unknown> device to a <unknown> .
so , the best thing that you 're going to do is `` the <unknown> is the <unknown> , '' which is a lot of <unknown> , that 's a massive amount of information is a little bit of a <unknown> .
there are studies that are shown that there are , there are , that we have studies that do n't show .
what we 're doing is that the key is that the <unknown> of the <unknown> is <unknown> , and so much of the <unknown> performance of improving the <unknown> .
and coffee is also a good <unknown> because he 's <unknown> <unknown> , we were able to show together in conjunction with <unknown> <unknown> , and the building <unknown> of paris ,
so , armed with a nice and scientific study recently published for the last few people who have been met for decades , that people who have spent every night <unknown> every day to save two percent , when they were <unknown> their <unknown> to the <unknown> percent of the
this is a tremendous value worth of <unknown> evolutionary study .
and it 's for <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> .
but not only , for peanuts , the <unknown> are the <unknown> <unknown> things .
the only one of them are only allowed to get rid of them , ok , okay ?
but it 's actually not bad . but it 's actually a bad thing .
so , together , we 're not going to try to hide out of the equations .
the next point is a little bit more <unknown> .
do n't take the sheet of a product that 's a human creature , so from the water and the <unknown> , but only if you 're between the <unknown> and <unknown> years old .
so , the very beautiful new yorker shows that if you put in a <unknown> , you 're going to take a lot of other plants proteins , you can get into a <unknown> so much more than the
it 's not the way that there 's been a little bit more like the animal waves are , and it 's not the best for children 's health , or entrepreneurs that need the proteins to do it , and it does n't want
it 's actually <unknown> , it 's not <unknown> <unknown> .
whatever you 're doing , they 're <unknown> , who was <unknown> , who was the <unknown> <unknown> , the <unknown> <unknown> , the <unknown> <unknown> , the <unknown> <unknown> , the <unknown> <unknown> , the <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> is the <unknown> of the health .
all the <unknown> is about the <unknown> in the los angeles .
this is the gentleman that 's <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , which has been seen by this concrete , and he 's been <unknown> years old years .
it 's coming from my home <unknown> , and the <unknown> of my <unknown> , is never been sick sick .
it 's very good .
it 's not a <unknown> farm that no longer <unknown> , but it 's living in a <unknown> , and it 's in a <unknown> where it 's particularly many people 's <unknown> ,
it has been estimated that <unknown> followed by the <unknown> that i told me to today .
we should have to talk about all the <unknown> experiments that are not really , very important , but we really ca n't get a lot of <unknown> , but it 's mostly enormous .
because the <unknown> of the <unknown> of the <unknown> of me , not <unknown> , not a way of being able to be a <unknown> but a <unknown> , and then eventually , to <unknown> a <unknown> , and so finally , a <unknown> , and so on a <unknown> ,
you can <unknown> the old people less than you can have a single person , and it could be one of the most valuable mistakes of our culture .
<unknown> wrote a great novel of the <unknown> <unknown> a year ago .
the brothers came out of the <unknown> .
a work , in the conversation , in the philippines , the traditional meditators , the traditional entities , <unknown> mothers are <unknown> <unknown> .
thank you for your attention .
i want to start with a question that i 'm going to do with you , and i want to be happy to you .
one question where nobody has to leave you because , that 's a little bit of <unknown> , who is a little <unknown> , which is from a person to get fresh ?
but the <unknown> is really a small thing . it 's very small .
less than i was still depressed than i thought .
but it may have reasons why they were not going to have , but the people who would be just a <unknown> that 's because the people would be <unknown> .
many people shredded <unknown> and denial and thinking and so that would be <unknown> , and that would be <unknown> , and that would be <unknown> .
and that 's not the case .
and instead of loneliness is really rather to be a phenomenon of people 's being a phenomenon among people as a way , too , too .
maybe it 's also that you 're not going to have not <unknown> because there 's a question of a question .
does you feel secure or make it or make you feel lonely or is you feel useless ?
you can feel secure for yourself , make it be able to be without lonely without having a conversation .
and you can be able to make diagnostics without without feeling in feeling of comfort .
and also , a designer has to do with a lot of fun with shame .
but that 's now what 's going to do now have here now from shrimp here , and you 're now going to be able to <unknown> the nuclear power of precaution , and we 're going to be honest of loneliness .
mastery is particularly comfortable with shame and why , in a way , it 's a <unknown> in a matter of mathematics .
mastery takes time time .
so , because of course , there 's no one show here , there 's no one minute where there 's a few seconds i 've been you going to have you 've been showing you .
mastery is <unknown> needs to <unknown> needs .
mastery is the time to help yourself be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be consciously consciously in the way that you 're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
and nuclear power also also helps me to talk about it .
and the practice is not , we do n't own any longer either .
we do n't have the language to the fact that we have to sign the language for ourselves , where are we lonely ?
there are a philippe of a <unknown> <unknown> of a while i 'm going to happen in a moment , and i 'm going to be a little bit further in orbit , and i 'm going to be there .
the part of humanity is saying , you 're from the beginning to work on the schools .
from the birth to the death , you 're actually just trying to make a lonely .
there are few moments in life , you can be able to be able to resist the <unknown> in the place where you can <unknown> the <unknown> .
these people often are often trying to <unknown> and get the whole day , and all the day , they 're all over the day .
i did n't have no time , and so on the <unknown> , you know , the <unknown> <unknown> .
and then there are people less likely to spend less about that , which is , all of all , is connected to everything .
and i do n't really do , and i 'm just one part of the great universe .
and there 's the great group , which is also , i think , is , that 's the way that we think , is , think that 's how the way you think that way , think that think , think that think , think about that .
and think , think , okay , today , i 'm lonely and today , i 'm going to be able to make the next day and the next day , '' but it 's all <unknown> together .
when we think about it , rather , really , curious about the truth , the first thing , the first thing is , really , the first thing is , really , the first thing is a very controversial conflict , is a really interesting thing .
the elegance of the <unknown> , the sheer <unknown> of the <unknown> of a <unknown> on a diagnosis of a <unknown> .
but over this <unknown> , that little <unknown> , i 'm not talking about today , but i want to talk about the little bit about the little bit about the little bit about the little bit , more <unknown> , where the <unknown> can be able to do this in a theater .
i do n't want to talk about a lot about burden and talk about the <unknown> , and the <unknown> of the <unknown> ,
so , rather , in other ways , you have n't to think about hard , you do n't think , rather than really , really , really serious , by being a serious serious by us to have <unknown> to us , and we 've been <unknown> to them , and <unknown> , and we 've got to make sure we 've been doing .
the bbc remembers christine <unknown> a couple of photographs that show me some pictures that i want to show you .
how simple it is going to try to figure out how to measure from other nuclear power , and then it 's like a rather scary to act of how it works in the way of itself .
we do n't know , if we do n't know if these people were really touched in this moment , that they were really afraid of being <unknown> and <unknown> .
but who do n't know , the knowledge of the <unknown> event where you think , you know , everybody 's thinking about each other , you 've got to lose something else in the corner and has anybody to have anybody to have
and all of this sudden , <unknown> of <unknown> realize all of us here are already aware of all of this .
maybe some of you have a few years of time now .
what you do is to do is the cell phone really , and many of them are really good at all right now , the most important thing , the <unknown> <unknown> , the <unknown> <unknown> on the mobile phone .
clearly , if you look very carefully , if you look at the display , you see it , you can see it , you can see it , you can see it , you can see it , and you can see it , you can see it , you can see it , you can see it , you can see it , you can see it , you can see it , you can see it
what we do n't do here .
yes , and then the nuclear power of the things that we 're doing is , and the sheer <unknown> of the right is showing you an extension of a <unknown> device on the cell , and you can tell you something that we did n't want to have his banjo .
these are the <unknown> <unknown> that you see from the outside of the outside , and you can see it , in the outside world .
we give you to persuade people to give people to each other .
but i 'm sure there are also people who are about death in school , their lives long as long as they tried to do , they 're trying to <unknown> this <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> .
and there 's also in the room , people are the musical people who are having a healthy , because they have to have a different person to be because of a child , or because of a <unknown> .
there 's also nothing that there are only so many people who are also more people , but people are connected to them , they are feeling lonely , they feel morally lonely .
and there 's people who have lost their own even even more comfortable , and therefore so help , and so <unknown> .
i called the <unknown> of the digital conflict .
and you 're sitting on the <unknown> of the <unknown> , rather than the <unknown> documentary , '' because it 's a <unknown> act of wonder .
the <unknown> nuclear nuclear power is kind of a bit of a <unknown> rather than us .
these are people who are asking for their opinion , they 're thinking about social networking .
and it 's still relatively rare .
there are no <unknown> number , no <unknown> number , if someone has no human ability to be , not as if it does n't exist , not as much as it is not .
we immediately looked back to the old people immediately immediately immediately .
it 's the <unknown> form of conflict .
but since we all have to live together in cities , for many people in facebook or every single or lung or 15 or facebook , these digital conflicts is actually becoming more important .
you can be connected to hundreds of people without a <unknown> , not to be with a single person to be right right ?
it 's the dominant way to get the <unknown> of human relationships , which is essentially the way of the digital rather than the healthiest gravity of the relationships of the relationships .
the two forms of discovery , as a lot of <unknown> are going to be very often more of their own communities .
and so , it 's also , the <unknown> <unknown> is a <unknown> manifesto <unknown> , and a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
whereas digital digital spins very much for <unknown> and <unknown> in <unknown> and <unknown> in <unknown> .
it 's about that the digital agreement is going to be the digital initiative in the future , and if the opportunities to connect the possibility to be , are going to be more , bigger .
i do n't know if you think about 20 years , you know that you 're going to be a similar thing , rather than the <unknown> is a <unknown> , is particularly fascinating .
and if you can find a new term for this new way .
but that 's also the way that the problems of the <unknown> generation .
almost bigger than the torture itself is fear of the nuclear and the reason of fear of the <unknown> of the people of a question of loneliness , people are willing to do with them .
<unknown> , the great <unknown> , and a <unknown> person has written written a wonderful person , and a <unknown> man wrote a wonderful <unknown> <unknown> .
in what you know what is what people tell everything to be not to be alone alone .
they build cathedrals , they find kids in the workplace , then they are able to go and make them move and make themselves more and they alone .
but the <unknown> <unknown> did n't you say to <unknown> the fear of the generosity , and to spend money .
go home .
things we want to do things like the <unknown> .
and the process of the process is the sheer bang , and the frequency of the proton , because it 's kind of a <unknown> thing , and it 's going to be able to cope with a quick event , and the objects that you have to do is , and you can grieve , and you can teach them .
problem is just about it all the way that helps help it all the way that it 's very , and then , that this <unknown> <unknown> of the conflict is to be a permanent threat to the conflict .
so we have to buy that we have to buy new things together as we have to make new things in the new way .
i 've been able to give the <unknown> to a <unknown> conspiracy to a <unknown> telescope .
and the <unknown> is all of a <unknown> of a communication of mobile communications that is <unknown> to a <unknown> of the <unknown> , and i think it 's a key from the point of it .
what the thing is , if you have to do , do n't do , you do n't have , but apparently it 's also worked , it has been too .
so , greenpeace does n't matter anything with the <unknown> industry , rather than the way , in fact , is actually a way of a matter of fact , rather than the way of people , as well as humans as well as well as humans like .
<unknown> <unknown> wrote a wonderful poem , and there 's a <unknown> , but there 's a <unknown> , but it 's a <unknown> , and the most important is the <unknown> to the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
hand on the heart of the heart , who do n't know this ?
in a relationship , or you can see the people and the other people , and also , you feel very vigorous , feel lonely , and feeling the question , who is the person who can do that person 's
i could do something to do something that i could do with doing something that ? i could do something that ?
one study that you have to think is a <unknown> women at the most women who are married , their children , married , with children , who , thank you , children , feel better , so children .
now , the lack of the people , because there 's no longer yet if i 've invented , i 've invented the study even more recently , i told you , i think ,
but it 's not even true of time because we do n't even know of studies , and the response is always the best thing to be in front of me .
the term is just a hypothetical example , which is just very obvious , is a <unknown> , which is a <unknown> <unknown> .
rather than <unknown> is <unknown> to every every day , and yet , we 're not talking about them .
talk about just this little bit about the nuclear power of sex in the <unknown> .
it may also probably even have a couple of people .
even though we 're <unknown> , once suddenly , you think , think of thinking , what do i do here , what do i mean ?
who 's this person in my bed in my bed ?
also , this is a form of miniaturization as a consequence of the principle of the needs of the needs of the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
nothing to do have to do anything with the quality of relationship with the relationship with relationship with the relationship with relationship with the relationship with relationship with nothing .
it 's just a place where there 's always there .
we 're not talking about them , because we do n't look at them , we do n't look at them .
we 're not talking about it about not in the workforce .
in the world , the mastery is also <unknown> as activism as we think , think about it .
i was a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , and i saw a group of five minutes , better thinking , `` other masterpieces , i was playing a little suit suit , and i was <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
the two men have learned that they have the ones that were given the two women in the <unknown> , they have died of the people .
and in fact , in fact , in fact , a <unknown> , which is a little bit more <unknown> , which is a <unknown> <unknown> with the <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> .
i think i have to do n't have to do the scene at the same way with the shape of oneness , which has been able to have found a lot of time in its lifetime , and then in the future , has been able to have <unknown> back in its lifetime .
it 's the <unknown> of the nuclear power .
but also , it 's also the threat of the <unknown> .
we all know the <unknown> , or i think , you may be , you may be able to give you some of the other people who are <unknown> their lives in <unknown> , you know , <unknown> .
in <unknown> , in <unknown> in port-au-prince , in <unknown> , the <unknown> lot often often have no knowledge that they 're actually going to do what they 're doing .
where they are where they 're marching up .
also , this is also a form of conflict that 's going to be talked about .
it 's just as a result of <unknown> , like reddit can be treated as a <unknown> player , and then instead of <unknown> , can be done by a <unknown> player .
<unknown> is <unknown> <unknown> here .
i told a story told that he was told to him , he was written by a customer , and he told me , it 's what it was all about <unknown> , you ca n't imagine it .
a <unknown> <unknown> was only in the lunchroom .
so he was <unknown> to the <unknown> , and he was able to <unknown> himself to the <unknown> .
and then two months later , he 's also <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
the nuclear bomb never happened to be able to be able to be able to do n't just deal with it .
and we always always connected to the other emotions .
it has beautiful pictures of the limbs , and she has a horrible siblings and she has horrible sentences with the very small thing .
the same ones that we all know the same siblings is all of all the time that we all do .
fear , by despair , ladies and anger , why not so well .
but we should also forget the great siblings .
the freedom of freedom is to say the desire to offer the <unknown> <unknown> .
so my <unknown> is looking at the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
and , and come and come up in the way , like , like , like , how about tide like the tide and <unknown> ?
let me stop and you do n't let you go to your own .
because there 's something much more than more than as a controversial and this is the emptiness that might be considered by the mastery of a <unknown> when you 're not doing something more strange .
mastery is part of life .
and i 've been so fortunate to think about scientifically , very recently , i 've been thinking about a lot of adventure for me , and i 've been able to change the things that i 've been doing , i 've been doing things for the things that i 've been doing .
one in my favorite days i do n't have a more nerdy dictator of the <unknown> , i 've always been sending him why i do n't know how he could n't eat any longer because i think i could make myself people , i 'm going to become a lot of people , maybe i 'm going to be able to make sure i 'm lonely .
i 've been honored since i 've been fascinated by the situation where i 'm proposing to unveil the life of people , and come out to the time .
so , it 's exactly how it 's a <unknown> where you do is doing it .
and i 've been a <unknown> , and i 've become a second .
people come and go to the <unknown> , not to make them more , but if you could have a <unknown> or a national one , and i could have a partnership .
when a child , i found a little embarrassing ambition to be a little bit miserable .
they ca n't even have any difficulty in any <unknown> without any <unknown> without someone to talk about a conversation .
whether or in the middle of the food or the economy or in the economy ,
and so it 's time to take a grant study to a lot of time , and we 've got to come back to a variety of lessons .
as a child , i found a signature ambition to me , like , embarrassing , i was embarrassing , i was supposed to be told me .
as a young village , i 've been able to get it incredibly incredibly adept for making this openness to this particular , and i have to have this trend for this openness .
but only since i was working with myself so in a nuclear attack , i 'm going to go even at least at least at the same time , and i also started to <unknown> myself too much to play on it .
now , it 's a sense of the way that you 're going to be <unknown> , is called the way to do is willing to make the first possible for the next possible .
thank you very much .
yes , thank you very much .
i 've been doing three of the most commonly <unknown> of the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
a <unknown> <unknown> gives a <unknown> and a <unknown> <unknown> .
and i 'm afraid you 're wondering , if you just take a clue to what extent you would take you from the <unknown> , what would you take ?
most of the people who decide who would decide to protect the <unknown> .
and this is a little good idea to tell you a little good idea .
why ?
because by talking about the only thing that we need to do is the best effort is going to be able to do the biggest effect of the world .
in terms of health , we 're doing this kind of different ways .
so , we 're doing the way that we have the effect of the biggest effect about `` the origin of the origin of the <unknown> is deciding us and ask us to other people , and make us available for other strategies .
we 're asking to the first for the <unknown> , and the point of the <unknown> and the theme of the <unknown> and the theme for sports .
so , big , big , but big , big , big , big , big , big , big , big big problems .
so , i do n't really know that valuable to us so valuable .
or we decide to decide what we 're going to do is to make us for the <unknown> .
it 's empathy , for food .
but also , very large amounts of <unknown> but also , very large <unknown> <unknown> still has very big power of <unknown> .
so , i did n't really know why , not so valuable .
and i want to tell you about the story about how you can do with the ted interest in the most recent game of the most <unknown> , the most <unknown> of the brain systems can be used to the most of the most <unknown> .
if you 're in trouble with prevention and health , you do n't have to be part of a topic for you , not just a issue on us .
the topic of the comet is the negative force .
and the theme of the minister of the minister was a <unknown> in germany long , so much of the <unknown> , so about the <unknown> in the <unknown> .
and then the number of the people in the <unknown> of germany , in the very <unknown> of germany , are packed in germany .
and i asked myself , what was i doing in the <unknown> <unknown> ?
why were that all came up to the whole thing all the way after the top of the top ?
and then i got research on the research , and i 've become a <unknown> and i 've been <unknown> <unknown> .
because it was just in the museum of <unknown> <unknown> .
what was there ?
there was <unknown> <unknown> coming to germany , germany ,
and we always always be and more and more relevant ?
and i looked at the film looked at the beginning .
<unknown> comes out <unknown> to germany to go to germany .
the burning drops is rising .
and in the course of the year , the <unknown> <unknown> takes the right thing to go to the scene of the curve , and then we get the <unknown> right now .
what happens then , what 's next ? irony
<unknown> and <unknown> and <unknown> and <unknown> and <unknown> , and how the <unknown> is something like that .
and we 're always going to always be and then still ?
well , then i put one of them and one of the <unknown> <unknown> .
because it was clear that there was clear .
sports is dick , dick , dick .
but of course , i 'm not going to come here to be here today to tell you that the deceased is saying , `` sport is power . ''
because that 's not true .
but one of the things that we found in , we 've seen now in common now .
the <unknown> of the new training -- and the <unknown> has n't been to make sure that we 're going to be able to be <unknown> and we 're going to be able to be able to make <unknown> and healthier .
so what is it possible ? so what is it ?
what ? is , how hard ?
and there 's also a very serious scientific crisis that 's very important in recent recent states of the states .
also , the other thing that are also the problem with <unknown> , who is the problem with illegal cancer .
they 've been able to put in <unknown> <unknown> .
and then you wanted to look at a quick conclusion , what happens to happen , what happens to happen ?
and you 've seen that people are just getting less fat on the ground , but people are still using less calories to better than but also more complicated .
and this was emily .
and so they called the <unknown> .
what do we do explain what ?
and you can also be able to take the body as you could imagine a <unknown> mechanism .
so we have so much a lot of hype in this kind of <unknown> <unknown> .
and on one page , you 're a <unknown> , because we 're all the <unknown> of the <unknown> , which is where we 're going to come up here , and you can get out here .
and this is the energy that will change energy as electricity .
but if we 're going to give you a <unknown> in here , we 're going to go to the power of food , as we 're going to move on the other side of the food system , the energy in the power and it 's <unknown> .
the human body is not not ever <unknown> under the <unknown> , and the <unknown> body is not entirely <unknown> .
the can make the energy we can make the energy .
and in a form of fat , apart from the top .
our most important and <unknown> <unknown> of <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
what happens when we 're spending less than we 're going to take energy energy , and yet , you can see that , the energy will turn it into a device to it just merely read it .
the <unknown> industry has dramatically dramatically dramatically dramatically dramatically dramatically .
this is no idea where there 's no life anymore , no one more than ours .
we 're only more mobile phones .
and that 's exactly what happens .
our grandparents are <unknown> <unknown> to two days of a long ago , and we took back to 18 miles away from a long time .
and we 're going to start to take a look at a top of two miles , and that 's where we 're going to be a long range of two miles , and that 's the positive estimates .
there are trials that we 've learned about five , which is about five <unknown> -- until <unknown> meters .
i 'm going to tell you about a little bit of a little bit of <unknown> with the friend , who 's teaching my friends , and i 've got a lot of writing experiments .
do you give me yourself to the <unknown> ' song ?
mike , are you engaged in the way .
mike 's american .
he 's shy , he 's still not going to be much better .
and he was at the time there , and he was in this study at the study , and it 's now in the study , and there 's now a point in the process of the room , and there 's now now here , here 's a little bit here .
he 's this typical <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , and he has a <unknown> in the hand .
and mike 's always always less less and still less and less only time , and yet he 's always going to always be getting and bigger and more effective .
why ?
because mike 's just happened now .
and i started looking at how much movement mike was so on the day and i 've been a <unknown> , and he took a <unknown> back in the pocket and i did n't go back back to the evening .
and it was a thousand steps of it .
this was the distance , the conversation , the spring of the morning , from the morning , from the car , the car in the car , and then on a car , we get a little coffee coffee and come back back .
and he came out to a lot of steps .
this is mike mike was at 10 minutes of his shoes 10 minutes .
<unknown> hours and <unknown> minutes at work , days of childhood , or <unknown> , and mike 's dreams .
in this conditions , in particular , that 's a lot of circumstances in the way that we 're in a disease , or ethnic illness are alone .
and mike 's not really being <unknown> because he 's too much food because the long time he 's getting more open to the energy , but it 's always going to always be <unknown> and the energy <unknown> .
and first , the first thing that the energy is about the energy , as you can see here , you see here on the <unknown> , you see it in your <unknown> <unknown> .
but energy is <unknown> , it 's not possible there .
the first thing to end up at the back of the blood vessels , in the blood vessels , <unknown> <unknown> , and you can go back to the <unknown> .
and again , it 's also <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> and quiet <unknown> and quiet on his <unknown> <unknown> .
so the <unknown> <unknown> .
so when the energy <unknown> into the blood , then the doctors are <unknown> at high horses , and high <unknown> <unknown> .
and this <unknown> , the <unknown> , which is <unknown> , like <unknown> , <unknown> all the holes in the <unknown> .
and happiness was still up all of the whole apartments , and that turned out over the little bit , and that turned over this little <unknown> and we talk to <unknown> <unknown> or <unknown> .
and now , <unknown> heart is very under the <unknown> , because now , he 's going to have to go out the blood through these farmers , or we talk about high school <unknown> , and we talk about high school .
and if that high school <unknown> <unknown> on this <unknown> , it 's <unknown> , like , if you 're <unknown> , it makes you in the body , it 's in the body .
and when the bottom of the things happening , we 'll call the heart attack , we call the heart attack .
and when the landing in the head is that we 're going to call the stroke .
and in germany , germany , every second one of the heart is heart of heart disease , and a lot of heart of heart and <unknown> .
that means , in germany , every second is <unknown> <unknown> , and every year in <unknown> .
so , art , it 's not very sick of it because he 's not a sports , but it 's just not moving away .
and if you do n't know this , you know , you know , you know , you know , you 're going to be able to do the same thing , and you 're always going to be the wrong thing .
for example , for example , for example , a compassionate diet , for example , is a little bit more than the <unknown> .
i 've had a thousand of the time in amsterdam , i 've got <unknown> <unknown> in the north of the <unknown> , and there are <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> technologies , <unknown> .
and if every book is only a $ thick and we would look at this , we would have a <unknown> , we 'd be a <unknown> blanket a hundred meters of the <unknown> <unknown> technology .
and i 've read the way you read about it all of them .
and there 's in the way , and it 's really important if you 're more energy than more than you 're going to be <unknown> .
and if you take less energy than you 're going to be <unknown> , you will be thin thin .
this is brilliant .
but why do we need to write books books ?
that 's just a conclusion to just a conclusion .
and the alternative is , of course , there 's huge but <unknown> , of course , there 's huge but <unknown> <unknown> is not help .
because why does a diet for a lawyer ? a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet , and no diet , and no lifestyle .
what the computer that we 're doing , the <unknown> that we 're doing here for three weeks and a half weeks later , we 'll go to this struggle , back in our normal lives , to our normal lifestyle .
what 's the first time , then , what 's ] the next five minutes of seven or seven weeks ago ?
nothing .
except for a <unknown> and again a <unknown> in the confidence that we did n't have done the thing we 've done in , what we 've done in us .
so they need to come to live today , every single diet , <unknown> , to all , and all of us will be able to get their lives in their own lives , in their own food , and
yes , no , no ?
and if you take the <unknown> , if you go to the <unknown> .
and if no , you 'll keep it easy to do it , and let 's just stick it .
because if you do n't get rid of the end of the end , it 's camilla <unknown> .
and the laws of the rules that they might decide whether they 're going to be a little bit about what we 're getting sick or healthy .
these are the bad habits that are <unknown> with us , and we 're a lot of men who are sick and more .
and the good insects that are doing good men that are always doing me healthy .
and when mike 's eyes in the mirror , the other sees the light is a place of a <unknown> of his everyday lives .
when mike 's eyes in the mirror , it looks like he 's going to go back to the everyday behavior , and then it does n't look at the everyday habits .
and when mike 's work in the mirror and the point , it can also be able to go to see where he 's going to be the same way .
because if he <unknown> more bad habits as good , it 's good at the time , and then it 's just a way to go in education ,
and when mike 's head in the direction of a sense of awareness of his goals , he describes his dreams , he does n't have to go into his life , and it 's not going to be moving into life .
then it takes only good good , and it takes only more positive habits as bad as bad as bad as bad data .
and a <unknown> habits mike <unknown> is also a great example of a very interesting example that the person is a strange animal .
mike has been given to the number of reasons , completely completely completely completely from his life while he 's <unknown> by its own life of his own life , and he uses a <unknown> , and it 's using a coin
and the evening he sits <unknown> on the couch , and it has to be kind of <unknown> <unknown> to come back to motion .
so he <unknown> up his head in his <unknown> , and then she 's a <unknown> , and i 'm sure there is a `` <unknown> rat , '' and then , like this , '' which is a <unknown> rat , so that 's a <unknown> , and then it starts to move on movement .
and my grandpa had just been <unknown> exactly how they were <unknown> like them , and they were looking at it .
the one of the one was a farmer , and they did n't have understood that they were n't understood .
the one , if they had had , `` you 're not going to move , and the <unknown> is for whatever they 're doing is not move .
and it 's kind of interesting one way .
why do we have to always have the same time in our <unknown> , and we have always always to make the decision that we have n't even given the choices we 've ever done in the future of life ?
in fact , we 'd have to have today 's going to be a few words in this <unknown> lifestyle hours a day .
and so , as a result , it 's very much easier to find the movement to find where we lost them .
in the same day , right now .
so i 'm going to give you an example of a little bit of a <unknown> demo .
you may have to know the situation where you 're still playing a evening at the lab and i realize that there 's no real one .
and you can see that this is what 's <unknown> , which is a <unknown> <unknown> of this <unknown> in us .
we always want to go to the coarse-scale because we 're going to go to the coldest of this .
we 're talking about , we 're starting to take our apartments , and we 're starting to have the <unknown> ways of the way we have to do the same way of behavior .
we 're talking about our whole life that we have the <unknown> ways of nature , but we do n't have a place where we 're going to have the outside world , where we 're <unknown> .
it 's in a completely different direction .
so you can get to get the <unknown> around the world , and the movement will be able to find out the point where they 're coming from , they 're coming from them .
i like to love to say , for example , i 'm happy to go to the <unknown> .
and i 'm the only one that 's always getting down and down and down and down and down and all the other ones .
but if i 've been there , i 've been <unknown> , i 'm still going to be the time for me , and i 've been doing time for me .
then i was the <unknown> , i 'm just going to make the movement that just has so far from that .
and when the <unknown> comes down , you 're 30 to a 30 percent of a <unknown> , say , `` i 'm <unknown> , '' `` i 'm <unknown> , '' because i 'm <unknown> <unknown> .
<unknown> steps steps .
that 's about three times about three times 10 times 10 minutes .
and a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , if you 're going to go back every day , we 'll say that you could not be <unknown> out of the end of the bed of the bed of the bed of the bed of the bed of the bed of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the back .
now , perhaps , this might be relatively short pleasant .
but as a <unknown> , as a <unknown> , as a <unknown> , once <unknown> <unknown> , once <unknown> <unknown> , i 'm speaking to four degrees of five pounds of fat .
we do n't have in our body .
and you give me a degree of time to show up this , and i 'll always get it to the <unknown> of the <unknown> , and i 'm going to be <unknown> him .
the americans are the crazy thing that are shown that the people are showing out what they 're looking at here .
this is a <unknown> of five pounds of fat .
i mean , i think , of course , i 'm going to have four pounds of wars .
just to look at what 's happening here , which is what happens to this little bit of what 's happening to those little bits of your steps .
and if that 's the effect of this angle , what i mean what 's going to happen , what happens when you really start to start , if you really moved through a whole life of life .
and these <unknown> <unknown> you 're going to get to the day every day in the everyday lives .
when they 're in addition to a little extra steps per day , they 're in a small pair of land , they 're in virtually every single day of the time , they 're in virtually all the <unknown> , it 's <unknown> almost all of the <unknown> .
and if you can look at the way , and then , you have the time and then you have time in sports , you make it <unknown> , you know , you know that , you know , you know that , you can <unknown> this on top of the top .
they then even have a <unknown> , and then they have the <unknown> of the <unknown> , and then they have the <unknown> <unknown> .
they 're still going faster , and they 're still faster and more .
but they do n't care about the health , they do n't make the environment anymore , and in a health , we can not live in sports health .
so they 're not their own longer their own more dependent on their appearance and their own , and their own time .
because the most important thing about the most important of the most important of the most important of the right now , the most important thing in the time you 're doing is a very good job of living as a lifestyle experience .
and i 'm <unknown> a <unknown> of a bigger lifestyle .
and for me , it 's more than a lifestyle , for me , it 's a <unknown> <unknown> that 's worth a clear decision that is for the life , and for myself , for me .
because i think , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you do n't think of what you should do with what we should do with what we should
but it 's a way to do what to do with is what we want to do .
and so i 'm just talking about a idea for a moment for a moment for you today .
just just just just imagine the best for the best .
and now , you know , you know , you know , it 's also about how it goes .
step forward step .
so thank you very much indeed .
`` what does n't he <unknown> a psychologist , leonardo da vinci , so far , is that incredible , so <unknown> , how much of the way of thinking about it , in the world with other eyes ?
and even even more time , even though , on the <unknown> , what 's just <unknown> , and what happened in his time , was a <unknown> , <unknown> ?
could we possibly be so much ? why ?
have you may just do what what do we do to do with the <unknown> ?
and how can we make sense of the power and confidence , for us to fix our future ?
let 's start with the question , what are we going to understand from innovation ?
sure .
technology 's research and research , and the <unknown> , even the <unknown> of the federal government has given the title of the federal government leaders , the <unknown> of the federal government leaders , the <unknown> of the federal government .
so you can understand what i 'm wrong .
that 's all great .
and we can be proud of this , and we 're going to be grateful that we 're working on in many many areas that our <unknown> are going to be well much of the world 's population , that we 're going to do
that we have actually found a remarkable , kind of , unique technological evolution has developed developed a lot of evolution .
but what about the future ?
what challenges are going to be there , because what is society to make us more ?
and who cares when you think about the big environmental and social challenges ?
so , it 's hard to seem to be kind of a way to be in a way to be in a way .
a kind of a <unknown> .
so the economy is about the ecological challenges because the entrepreneur then , the entrepreneur , the entrepreneur then , the entrepreneur , the <unknown> of the <unknown> we 've been moving from productivity and efficiency .
and the thing that the want to do the world better , if you want to find in the organizations and clinics and the way , and the thing that you need to do is also companies like , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , for example , are the <unknown> , and so , for example , the <unknown> of the <unknown> economy , to <unknown> the
and so , we 're going to fix that first , we can fix that in a <unknown> ,
but who says that we 're going to solve the whole thing as we 've been going to be able to look at the number of petrol ?
how would we be our system that we think about our social system of social and cultural activity ?
when technology can also be able to create physical laws at the same time , the way of physics , are we innovation , innovation ?
if economic economic laws of social relations are also known to the way that we 're learning to the process of innovation ?
if there are so much more striking and thinking of <unknown> , to design that with the global security and social challenges ?
if you look at the same amount of technologies , <unknown> <unknown> and the way of our careers , in a very different way , <unknown> <unknown> development ?
because how was that ?
both sides are supposed to be what they wanted to do , what ? '' ?
can this work ?
perhaps perhaps just ask them .
so , we 've always been doing this , and yet , we 've always been doing this as a <unknown> thing , and the last thing is that we think , is a problem of a problem .
luckily , there 's a couple of examples .
now , judy yunus with his <unknown> with his <unknown> , with his <unknown> <unknown> in bangladesh , there 's a lot of improvement , and the amount of energy around the world there is <unknown> .
and interestingly , much more , just in the very <unknown> of the <unknown> , just to <unknown> the actual <unknown> of what the chinese <unknown> has been done .
and he has <unknown> <unknown> as entrepreneurs , and we 've found a lot of surgical classes for the high school company .
and if the opportunity is that i 'm going to give you a <unknown> for me to make sure that somebody else could do something about somebody else , i know it 's a little bit about somebody else .
now , i think , well , i 'm going to give you a <unknown> <unknown> of <unknown> <unknown> .
<unknown> <unknown> <unknown> guy , a young man .
and more trained , it 's trained to be used to be a lot of power , but also also <unknown> the life .
and i mean , so , completely completely <unknown> .
i love to love the right .
and if you see the same , then you think , well , well , in the other , you 're very little to get our offspring , we need to make our future , but we need to make our future ,
yes , right after the era , he started to start working on a few minutes to a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
it 's also very good at all right now .
and so it 's totally <unknown> him and it 's been very successful in a long time .
and yet , there 's something that sits in the way that there 's nothing in him .
so he asks n't it not just more , because of the fact that there 's a little bit more , is a kind of thing i 'm doing in my ?
so this is the way the idea of <unknown> , he always always said , he 's going to always be able to go back to the other hand , and then he 'll always be able to go back to the other .
<unknown> <unknown> is all in the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
and also , it sounds very , and he looks like him .
and he also love it , it was also <unknown> this way .
so the right thing , the right thing is , the <unknown> , which he has found that right now .
so , he ca n't know him personally , but the <unknown> says this guy 's <unknown> , which is what it was like .
and in the middle of the middle of the <unknown> , the <unknown> , he did n't know .
so the more time he was surprised as though , when he was found that he was found that he was found , and then had been able to discover the patient 's opinion .
as a <unknown> , a <unknown> <unknown> .
and as an <unknown> , entrepreneur who was <unknown> , and he was able to read there .
the great big organization , so , with the creative joy , with friends with young people , who has his own work done that , and so that 's the most difficult thing to do .
and the two people found that they found found out of these pieces of shoes .
and they 've been doing some time , and they 've been doing some time , and they 've been still more recently .
what if we just do such a way of looking at the beginning of the two times ?
yes , so , <unknown> <unknown> , so what we did .
what 's the same thing about the difference between the <unknown> between the <unknown> between the <unknown> between <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> company ?
so i did n't really understand that well .
well , so , so , let 's start to start with the question of what 's a <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> company ?
so , `` the word says , `` yes , '' she said yes .
<unknown> markets , highly products , <unknown> customers , <unknown> customers , <unknown> structures , there are a <unknown> structures , and there 's a <unknown> problem .
and you can also get quite a lot of reference , which can be the kind of rigid , the big shapes <unknown> .
and just the <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , even if the very <unknown> is too much that , but also , it 's also too .
what is a matter of a <unknown> ?
so , <unknown> , you 're <unknown> you just one of the time it 's not going to be not the same thing to do not so much of the big company .
it 's something very different .
it has a completely different character , there 's a completely different character .
because it has n't even buy anything .
no <unknown> customer , not <unknown> <unknown> , no idea , no idea .
so from this point , a <unknown> organization that sends a common organization that is going to be a <unknown> , a <unknown> , a tool of how to <unknown> , is that it 's mostly <unknown> , but it 's actually <unknown> .
and you will understand that there 's all sorts of other advantages to the other organization , different colors , different colors , different colors , different colors .
yes , that 's me , and i 've already told you that .
but what are we going to do , are we going to be looking for ?
so i 'm going to <unknown> myself , and then i 'm going to make it any more <unknown> money , or if you can do it ?
so i 've also got to the extent that it 's very good at all , so <unknown> <unknown> has shown in the berlin in berlin , you would n't recommend it ?
this is called <unknown> .
how you 've got your professional successful successful and you have the <unknown> of your life , and you 've been able to have your life for <unknown> life .
oh no .
do n't matter real things ?
what do you think about if you think about the <unknown> , you 've got to be treated your body 's money , what 's a child 's energy , what 's your <unknown> ?
so , you know , you want to have a career as a <unknown> career , or what ?
what happens , if you 're looking at your creative , like i , you know , how do you know ?
and also , we 're looking at the <unknown> , and we 're looking at the <unknown> , and we 're looking at it .
so the statistics of <unknown> are not going to give you a <unknown> perspective , because 70 percent of all are <unknown> for a few years of a few years of a few years of this , and they 've been in a much more significant financial crisis as long as they have
and it 's always the result of a very <unknown> of a successful enterprise company and a very successful company , and a very successful company company , and a very successful company company .
sure , it 's a sense of money , it 's a power of energy consumption for investment <unknown> .
and it 's the basis of all the information that 's reduced economic elements .
but it never happened to be a goal of a company .
yes , what 's the goal ?
the company is doing a company ?
so , if i have a <unknown> , i learned to ask myself , so the goal is not a single point of the right .
so , goals should be a very good thing , but you may have to be extremely smooth in china , and so on .
and if i do n't know anything like this , so how can i do something like that i 'm not going to pretend to be ?
so i do n't really do n't make a good feeling of feeling that i do n't know me .
so how to i say , you know , and i think risks , that feels a lot of feeling for me , and i 'm <unknown> and <unknown> .
yes , <unknown> welcome to <unknown> , in the future , '' and <unknown> , welcome to the criminal economy .
but i may have just imagine what you 're doing for you .
a thread .
so the thing is , it 's already <unknown> , so , almost almost all the <unknown> is so that 's the secret thing .
successful <unknown> from generation generation eight generation to eight years ago .
a <unknown> <unknown> for <unknown> <unknown> .
so , how do you say today ?
<unknown> of what i do is i mean , `` <unknown> '' i mean ?
so we say , we always need to keep the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
in fact , the wireless states and <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> sustainable strategies .
so , it enables it to help helps it .
i think i 've got to give you a few minutes to you .
okay .
yes , thank you , mr. <unknown> .
but there 's only one of the questions of all of you , i think , right ?
now , you can think of you , probably , probably in the most important point of view is the best economic qualities , is asked questions about questions about the best possible .
can we have the point that we could find that , then , if you could get out of the other , i could understand that maybe i could understand anything like this ?
so the first is what i call here , what am i going to do here , what am i going to do here ?
yes , <unknown> , there 's a <unknown> of what 's going on , what 's going to be about you about what 's going on , about greater than you ?
what do you do in the world ?
what do people do if you do working with them , they 're working together with you ?
what are you going to give you ?
what are your inside , maybe , what is your imagination , '' but perhaps the literal <unknown> <unknown> ?
why is this important that the evidence is to identify ?
because that 's also the <unknown> of the <unknown> , because they 're their direct <unknown> .
and how did we learn this way ?
if you want to build a ship , you do n't want to make the men together , you 're going to get a big <unknown> of <unknown> , but teach them , to help , you know , <unknown> , <unknown> ocean .
yes , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well
so i then asked the next question .
what is my <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> ?
what does this mean ?
yes , <unknown> now you can actually bring your target really well , you can actually take your target back to the <unknown> , and i think ,
so , <unknown> <unknown> in detail , and i 'm <unknown> <unknown> on the moment of a moment when you 're going to get you to what you 're going to do to go to it , you will .
do you know what 's the story of the pink elephant ?
it 's a <unknown> that i took a <unknown> .
right ?
<unknown> .
so , indra go out there .
do n't notice any frank elephants before you ca n't wear any pink elephant .
okay ?
does it work ?
so , a pink elephant .
do you understand ?
not a pink ipod : no <unknown> elephant .
do you see ?
so we 're looking at this , if we focus on what we want to do .
what is the only way of the only way ?
and what 's happening about it ?
yes , sure , yeah , please , you know what 's going to do .
so <unknown> <unknown> or maybe the <unknown> <unknown> , or the <unknown> <unknown> on the <unknown> .
but suppose you 're doing a little bit of a sense of time .
by the way , what i do you think about that , or what do you think about it ?
i 've been a writer to give you a piece of paper .
<unknown> <unknown> if you 're looking for the <unknown> <unknown> . ''
<unknown> <unknown> <unknown> in the <unknown> <unknown> de <unknown> de smith smith smith , and smith smith smith .
who ?
at the end of the <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> to a <unknown> <unknown> , and <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
i <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> of you to <unknown> her own <unknown> <unknown> at the time of the time of the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
i 'm <unknown> the glass of the glass of the <unknown> <unknown> .
i 'd like to call <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , sir .
and what i call me <unknown> <unknown> in the <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> <unknown> .
<unknown> <unknown> rory was a <unknown> <unknown> smith .
oh , chris , first of all , <unknown> <unknown> people <unknown> <unknown> ?
<unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> a <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
<unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
it 's a <unknown> <unknown> of a <unknown> of <unknown> <unknown> .
the real <unknown> is the <unknown> of the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> ?
and <unknown> <unknown> like this looks like this ?
is what happened ?
what does it changed ?
okay .
okay , and then , and then , and then , and then , and so , and then , and so , and then , and so , and then , and so , and so , and then , and so , and so , and then , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so
okay .
so , now , let 's look at the moment , we 're going to be the united states , and we 're going to be a <unknown> .
and it 's extremely unsettling .
<unknown> <unknown> <unknown> in this <unknown> <unknown> psychologist william smith , smith smith smith smith smith .
who ?
at least , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , she 's <unknown> <unknown> to death with a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
i 'm <unknown> <unknown> from you to give you a <unknown> ted <unknown> , and i 'm going to give you a <unknown> ted tedtalk of the <unknown> of this particular <unknown> , and i 've been <unknown> at this point , and <unknown>
i 'm the <unknown> of the glass in the <unknown> <unknown> .
i 'm talking about what <unknown> <unknown> is <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , sir .
and i just call what my favorite friends were doing in the <unknown> <unknown> lab .
<unknown> <unknown> rory <unknown> smith <unknown> smith .
and <unknown> , how do you go to the way you do with it ?
so i 've still had , i 've also been shocked myself . i was also shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i saw the first time , i 've been the first time .
i thought that was the same thing i was n't really going to be surprised .
and more , more more depressed i was going to be through the head , and it 's the reason i really work to be all of the time of the world ?
through my life .
and okay , i understand that , it 's completely <unknown> .
to get the <unknown> of the <unknown> <unknown> , we can get the most of our perception of our perception and our <unknown> , to have the <unknown> first time , and we have to be <unknown> at the same time .
but what 's happening is , what 's happening is now , what 's going on here ?
what i call `` <unknown> '' '' and what i was doing and what i am doing in the <unknown> ?
and so , to make sense of you to feel your perception of each other , is a more important <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> human <unknown> .
well , yeah , thank you , so , well , you 're going to go next to the next question .
how could i come to my goal ?
so , i think that 's a good question for good question .
and the magic of me , i think , `` all of us , '' and i do n't know , not just continue to go to the way of doing it .
yes , <unknown> , there 's good news news to be good news for you .
this will be used you as though you 're known to be seen now by you already have seen this before you have done so now .
because if you 're all right , you can get your hand open , and when you 're doing this , and you can <unknown> them to the very <unknown> , i can imagine you , it would happen , it 's going to happen in a way of a
almost misunderstood .
you 're not going to be able to imagine even that a reasonable piece of music is that you 're going to be able to get out of you , to understand things that are going on , you know , you 're going to go out on you .
so these are the famous <unknown> you 've seen in the shower you 're under the shower .
and yet , for instance , what i 'm going to do is i think you 're looking at you for a moment you 're talking about , you might ask people who you wish to ask people , you might ask more people to get more and more to work more
and you also have a big model .
the <unknown> <unknown> has been the great <unknown> <unknown> .
<unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , if the time we knew more , was the time on the <unknown> in the <unknown> <unknown> in the <unknown> , and then she was writing in his <unknown> <unknown> in florence .
for lunch to talk about the famous big table .
and then they 're all there are so different people 's very well .
so , scientists , <unknown> , politicians , independence , engineers engineers , architect and he has a <unknown> response to the <unknown> , so i was a very <unknown> <unknown> .
but not in our current situation , which is the way we 've been doing , was , who is the people coming from ?
who 's right ? who 's right ?
and all of all of these sorts of things that are already from these different kinds of things that are already happening in some of these things that are so much in a way that could be done in a way that could be done with a way of time alone .
well , yeah , the next question is to say , what is the simple next step step on the physical next day , i 'm going to step back ?
<unknown> of it is good for the successful entrepreneur who are successful in entrepreneurs who just are just in the way to just be able to do it , but in fact , really <unknown> .
instead of design and design and doing so , and so on the way , just always just keep just going to just be just going to just take on the next step .
because what do you do to do is , what do you do to do in the area of uncertainty ?
but they have done this very kind of , and they have the very <unknown> and with all the way of that , and they have all the impression that you have .
and if it was nothing , it 's going to go , dan dan dennett makes us look at other other things .
and even if the big bang , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> does n't exist , it 's a better case for other people .
so this is so important that it 's all the idea that you 're clear to you that is clear .
you can tell you the way that you 're feeling in the way that we can use .
and in the other end , how did we have all of this time ?
so though , we did n't know that before we did n't know , and so there was no idea of no one , no one ?
it 's because you know , there 's also a <unknown> of kids in children .
so , this is how much learning to learn that this is , and this is a matter of <unknown> , and this <unknown> <unknown> is the same thing that it 's doing is that fun of doing this is in a business process in a <unknown> .
and it 's also quite a look at the <unknown> of the <unknown> against the uncertainty that everyone has <unknown> us all the other things as well as we do n't think of <unknown> .
yes , thank you an <unknown> <unknown> .
so this is the idea of the great thing about the great thing .
but i do n't know , in my company , i think you 're going to change a lot of nonprofit people , which is something that happens to be a lot of nonprofit people , something that happens to be something that happens .
and even in the other hand , in the time , there 's always been a lot of <unknown> here in the way that 's the way that we 're doing so is a very intuitive mood and so that 's the way we 're doing this , and so that 's the way we 're doing this , and so that 's the way we 're doing this is a very common mood .
and i think that , because i want to think , if you want to politicians , i want to politicians , that would be the politicians as much , that changes .
okay , my young son , come on , i was coming out with my boy , come on .
like , go back to the water .
what do you think about how many people can you do ?
ten ?
tens of thousands ?
ten million ?
look at it here , look down here .
who do you see ? who do you think ?
exactly , that 's exactly , the fact , the thing .
that 's the things that you can change is that you can change the way you can change .
or to put it to the <unknown> , who are the changing that you think about the world in which we 're looking at you in the world .
but you think about great words and great scientific , and how do you think about , what does it work ?
and we have now been able to have the number of <unknown> <unknown> , and we 've been <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> on our <unknown> <unknown> .
so , in order to all kinds of scenarios of crises , or if you 're too little to a little bit of a sense of something for you or , or if you 're a <unknown> , and you 've got all your own to do you with you .
and if you 're sitting in these situations , what you’re reading you now is to tell you about all of this in your knowledge , you know , you can feel physically hard to feel about it , you can feel very much .
`` well , just to what i 'm say'n in front of you , you know , you 're looking at <unknown> , you 're just looking at a moment of <unknown> , you know .
and finally , you 're just going to do you , what you 're actually from you about the crisis , or what you 're actually doing is this kind of thing that you have known is something that 's bad because it 's been done .
so , i mean , if you 've happened , you 've been there , it 's because she 's got to have that she has been there for six to her .
well , good good .
mister <unknown> thank you very much .
and do you really think that helps me to make myself feel my passion ?
yes , exactly right .
and imagine that the two things about two things about you all of these things .
first , eight squared is about the clarity of your clarity of view , that 's because what 's going to be <unknown> to your attitude , which is what you 're going to be created by what 's a technological way of information is to develop a tool .
because that 's what you do n't think about your perception .
and the second alternative , on the inner part of your inner attitude , you can imagine , depends on yourself , even though you 're coming from the other hand ,
because so , so , if you were to figure out how to others know how the other people are laughing to behavior .
and the future is always going to change our own perception .
do you give you a <unknown> ?
yes , i think , well , i think , `` well , i know , `` well , i know , `` well , i know , `` well , '' i said .
thank you , <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , so she 's going to go ahead and then <unknown> it .
all good news <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
yes .
what do you think about our <unknown> ?
and so many love .
really , or , <unknown> , huh ?
and how do we think it is that we 're going to now be able to do this with the <unknown> ?
is this a new <unknown> <unknown> ?
i mean , yeah .
it 's clear , clear , right now .
so , i 'm going to do things that are the most surprising places that are the same <unknown> experience .
<unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
and that 's what the <unknown> really is really doing .
a <unknown> of the <unknown> of the <unknown> of the <unknown> of the <unknown> of the <unknown> of the <unknown> department of the <unknown> .
no , no , new new <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> .
but the thing is the <unknown> <unknown> , but the <unknown> <unknown> is about the <unknown> .
the only thing about the time of the long time , in the long case , in the great famous name of <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
from robert thinkers about <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> or <unknown> or <unknown> , or how they all are .
let 's just look at the mind that we can literally understand this sense .
and the reason why all might do is that the evidence is that what we 've been talking about is our next leonardo of our time in our time , is that leonardo of our time .
you 're right , i 'm a <unknown> , i 'm a <unknown> , i 'm a <unknown> .
so maybe it would be <unknown> that i would help me and children with the future , and i think , children , i think , children are also our ability to our future .
instead , the most of the most important thing i 'm most of the most upbeat is i really enjoy most of the time of the time .
i spent a lot of my life in my life in prison .
four years ago , my father and i wrote the program of <unknown> , venezuela for centuries , <unknown> .
we <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , which means you can make a <unknown> or any tension in your life , you can also find it to the workplace that you can also be able to do .
why do i feel so well , to <unknown> , '' who have already conducted the big mistake ?
our program is not even very easy to understand how many people associate the kids to do kids .
and i 'm afraid that i thought that the <unknown> <unknown> of the last place is the last place in the universe that i would work .
what do you think is the most important factor of life in childhood with the people that we work with ?
we 've seen , there are a lot of scientific science scientists , many of the great scientists , special scientific scientific vision .
and if you think about it , it 's so much about them , and in many ways , there are many people in the same time , and there 's no good time that the father has no longer work that he 's going to eat drugs or that he 's eating in prison .
and if there 's a <unknown> boy about what he wants to do in his life , he might not be able to look better than a different idea of what might live life , it 's not better better .
he was his father to his father .
i 'm going to imagine <unknown> .
martin is <unknown> of our program .
his father was a <unknown> , and he had the whole family of life , and they were all of the family family life , and then the hell of life .
when he was 12 and his mother died , and his mother died , and he and his little brother had to be in his home .
and he was the <unknown> of the big bang .
he was shy and <unknown> and <unknown> and so the same day , and the perfect victim .
until the day of the <unknown> , when his little brother brother was so <unknown> , as a <unknown> , '' because that this is the end of the end of the end .
there was <unknown> to martin on the first time , the <unknown> <unknown> , he went to the enemy and go back to the enemy and he <unknown> to the <unknown> and go back to the enemy .
and the time he was able to leave his day .
so we went on .
violence is about being used to his life just as well as his father .
now what are the ones i mean , who i 've described , is that i 've been asked , is that ?
after childhood , after adolescence , many of the youth are many of us and <unknown> are <unknown> .
they do n't know much different than their underlying activities and their <unknown> <unknown> .
and then they 'll end up to the day where they 're doing in jail , and they 're going to be exactly like that , the idea of the ideas , the same ones are still better better than the other ones that are still better .
what do you think about these people are doing in life where they sit together in prison ?
but much of the most important , though , many of the good things are not good about good .
and they 're better better in the code of the code .
they sent them to drugs drugs on a higher level , and talk about the basis of the patient , and talk to the people where they could <unknown> the swim in their life .
and then it turns into the <unknown> of land , and then it goes to <unknown> <unknown> of <unknown> percent .
that means , in germany , every <unknown> is going to go to the car , the next <unknown> criminals are going to retire .
but then there are also the people who are there , but in the prison that are the prison that you want to change the prison .
but also these people who are a <unknown> who 's a <unknown> on the spinal cord .
there 's <unknown> .
and everywhere i get to come up , is the first identity .
whether you 're looking for a diet , whether you 're going to look at a basement , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
that 's the problem we 're going to have .
how do we try to solve this problem ?
what 's the implications , do you think , are many of a <unknown> <unknown> with your mouths ?
they will be surprised .
there are surgical skills .
and who has a building built up with a <unknown> <unknown> , which is a little bit of <unknown> , from <unknown> and <unknown> , <unknown> .
the first thing that we have the problem of <unknown> <unknown> is a little bit of <unknown> , otherwise , he 's not in the case of life he 's never invented in jail .
we can use this kind of features that we want to use a positive language for something positive .
we start to program our program with a <unknown> education in prison , in three <unknown> devices .
we 're sending the basics of vitamin entrepreneurship and economics .
every student <unknown> <unknown> his own <unknown> , and every time of a <unknown> of a <unknown> <unknown> item .
and then we took people to work with the living in the <unknown> , and the <unknown> in the <unknown> , the <unknown> of their personal relationships , and also within a few <unknown> .
what 's the <unknown> of the <unknown> of the <unknown> coming from the program ?
it 's a big range , which is <unknown> , like the <unknown> of the <unknown> , to the <unknown> , to the <unknown> .
we have a <unknown> <unknown> , and we have a <unknown> <unknown> of it , and we 've got a <unknown> <unknown> of it .
a very large bandwidth , and i 've been able to introduce you to think of a meter of it .
<unknown> <unknown> talent and his illusion of the eye was small by the money , and they 've been a very big deal with a lot of ice , and it 's got a very early in the <unknown> with a <unknown> to <unknown> .
he was always fun to do business . so he 's doing fun to do business .
he 's then <unknown> <unknown> at the first time , and she was arrested , and she was arrested , and she was arrested , and she was arrested .
and these days did not only put it almost particularly impressed .
in the contrary . contrary the contrary .
he 's saying to him today , he 's ready to write his second life back into his life .
<unknown> , he was also been the first time , and then he was also been the first time , and then he was also the third time , and then she was also a big <unknown> .
and then he took just a piece of paper and then he was part of a therapy and then on the <unknown> , and then on the <unknown> , and i was running at the <unknown> .
and then he learned how he was able to use his <unknown> training to a <unknown> , and <unknown> , can be able to use it to a <unknown> , and so <unknown> , can be able to use it .
he was introduced to the 1990s of <unknown> , and then we went to <unknown> the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> his <unknown> for <unknown> <unknown> .
the i.q of the brain is going to work on , it can live on it .
he has made it all of the <unknown> <unknown> , and she did n't feel good <unknown> <unknown> .
and i 'm now with this here tonight , and i 'm now today , i 'm going to be today .
and you 'd like to talk to you about someone who talk about you listening to him him .
again , martin luther martin , i wrote to the point that i had told to the beginning of my first time .
martin has been after his <unknown> , and he got a <unknown> to education , and went on his <unknown> in the <unknown> in the <unknown> in the <unknown> .
and there 's a smart and <unknown> and drugs that are under the threat , and the source of the board was played in a way of quickly , and then we were going to be a quick right answer to me .
he worked on <unknown> , and as long as a <unknown> , and as a <unknown> , and <unknown> <unknown> .
for years , he took this life .
and he says he says he 's going to be able to go back to this life , he 's not going to be <unknown> with this life <unknown> , and it 's going to be <unknown> with the <unknown> , and then it 's going to be <unknown> .
one day he sang somebody at a <unknown> , he was so he who was so he who was so he who was being used to be used to be used to be used to be used to be used to <unknown> , and then he was <unknown> , and then she was <unknown> , and then he had been <unknown> .
he took the story part of the story , and the <unknown> was really changed the life , and it has really changed its life .
he learned how he used to be more expensive to succeed and to live in the quality of without the <unknown> without any food without or <unknown> .
and he was about the mistake that he was so excited about his understanding that he was going to really like to share with it , and so that 's why we were going to be trying to share with it .
and he wanted to be part of the <unknown> .
that has been <unknown> .
it 's been working on for the two years of <unknown> and <unknown> our grandchildren at the way to the way to the time , because he knows that if you want to change the right tools with the hand , and if you want to
the basis of the successes of the successes are in the way people like them like they were .
people who are in the prison , they come to the courage to us , to come to the participants in their <unknown> , to their <unknown> , to their personal interest in their personal interest in their personal work .
these are our <unknown> , the <unknown> of our talks about our science , we 're going to have students to make the <unknown> , and the <unknown> <unknown> of the brain cells are <unknown> .
and that 's our interviews that our participants would be <unknown> directly by the deceased .
and then these people also take a lot of a lot of us with a lot of our program .
one example .
we 're going to do it , in a stadium , we make a practice called <unknown> , which we call <unknown> .
we put ourselves into the middle of the room , and we have a <unknown> <unknown> of our participants who are on our own , and our our mouths are in the one of the other and the <unknown> , on the other side .
and then i think different different questions .
and every time , if you 're living in the room in this room , he 's supposed to be the question of the line , and that 's the line of the line .
and here 's what we 're discovering is , where we have all together , we 're going to sit in within the prison , or outside of the prison or outside of the seats .
but also , where the differences are the same .
and one example of what the differences is , is the question , is the question of this , is the question of the other thing .
i was in a real social media , or i had a family of what i was born in a lifetime in a living room in a while in a long time .
there are many many of us who are often in many of us who are the ones at the line , and just very few of our efforts , and they were very few of our work together .
a question that i like to do is to ask the people that i 'm going to connect to all of us all the <unknown> , i love to help you ,
so i 'm going to tell you that you can come up to you all day .
maybe we can get a little light , you can get a little light , and we can get a little bit of the audience in the audience .
i can see you can see them .
it 's all of all .
great .
thank you very much .
i 'm now going to give you a question now , if you answer this question with yes , you can take them out , you 're going to be , you 're just going to be , you 're just going to be a little bit .
that 's what our way of our first we 've come to do now .
i 've done in my life , in my life , i 've been treated out of the <unknown> , but it was n't not .
if you answer that question , you can answer the question with you , you can answer you to yourself .
and what they 're doing is to make snow <unknown> snow is going to be a lot of risk .
and we may have to think , perhaps , to have low doses of paper , and have also a small amount of paper fiction .
and it 's because they 're not really <unknown> with the price of the body to the <unknown> , and they 're doing it , they 're going to be <unknown> .
okay .
and it 's also not possible , because every body 's <unknown> , not just have been broken up to be illegal , so <unknown> .
all right .
most of the parts .
we have some empirical <unknown> in the room .
this is wonderful , i 'm happy to suggest , i 'm happy to think of it .
thank you very much . you can all go back to each other .
in this question , if we take the ones that we have the study , our <unknown> come together often as much as the <unknown> , we 're going to be much more means to be a lot of time .
and many of them will also also have a clear conclusion that often happiness , but maybe happiness happiness may have ever been .
happiness with the young , happiness with the environment where they were growing up with their friends , but also , they would n't have to be able to go to the world of the <unknown> of the <unknown> , or also , they 've done something at the edge of the
what are the results of our work ?
<unknown> percent of our alumni are likely to find a few days of a <unknown> days from a <unknown> days of their <unknown> days , and in a <unknown> days , a <unknown> ,
that 's open fast fast .
<unknown> percent have already done a little bit of a little bit of a time .
a third of the penguins have been <unknown> , the number of penguins were <unknown> , and the year of the year were <unknown> .
and our <unknown> is about seven percent of the age of seven percent .
i 've been told the only thing of the <unknown> of the seven percent of a <unknown> <unknown> of a <unknown> in germany , and in the apollo age of <unknown> percent .
i 'm a <unknown> .
a <unknown> costs costs in <unknown> a year , the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> at the <unknown> <unknown> .
and it 's a beautiful <unknown> , <unknown> , which is a <unknown> of seven percent of a <unknown> <unknown> of a <unknown> <unknown> , which is <unknown> percent of a <unknown> .
when my father and i got the <unknown> , i was a <unknown> , we were open up pretty much like a few loved song , pretty soon .
i had my first time i had my <unknown> <unknown> in a great <unknown> in a big company in a big company .
but i have to tell you , i did n't really have a lot of work with my life , i did n't do so much of work for a life .
we 're learning our ability to take responsibility to get responsibility .
responsibility , what 's happening in your life is , especially , to be honest , to find responsibility for what 's going to happen to be in your life .
not to hide , i do n't hide , no <unknown> , no <unknown> , '' but anything else is <unknown> .
because that leads to a whole new situation , and it allows us to build the skills to the trust of the trust .
and so it makes me quite sure that 's pretty much , and i 'm proud of a <unknown> , and if you have a <unknown> , to give our collaborator on your journey , you know , your <unknown> , is to share with you .
i 've been able to give you a little video clip , and i 've got a little video clip , and i 've got a little video clip .
film <unknown> .
so i was convicted of <unknown> and two months and eight months ago , more than the <unknown> months of bad news .
i was convicted of <unknown> <unknown> for the <unknown> of the <unknown> years and a half months .
i was able to be able to take a bow .
so , i 've got the scrapper to two grandchildren for dangerous years because of the <unknown> , '' because of the <unknown> , '' <unknown> .
i was convicted of <unknown> because of <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> with <unknown> <unknown> .
so , through my suffering from <unknown> , it has actually changed my entire life .
and what i think was for important to me , this was important for me that the <unknown> machine is going to be done .
because i mean , i mean , i mean , my surprise was , my absolute <unknown> .
i was n't just a <unknown> , <unknown> , i almost say , `` yes '' because i was told , `` yes , '' because , '' because .
i 've been able to give back on the front row of eyes .
i 've been thinking about a moment of perspective , and i found a look at the moment , looked at the way , i 've been looking at the beginning .
and you 're dealing with a whole different awareness of privacy , and comfort itself out of the inner shoes .
and so , it was still more <unknown> without <unknown> without trying to make action goals and then it 's still <unknown> into something that 's <unknown> .
with the wrong people , and they 're not working together with the wrong ones and not <unknown> .
well , the problem is that many of us do n't have a <unknown> , if the parts of the ships are the same time .
the best problem is because then , that 's the <unknown> that it is going to be again , that 's okay , so that 's coming back in the old <unknown> .
you know nothing about it else .
through this <unknown> <unknown> , whatever it is all there , and i really all know about all of myself , i think about different , from your own human beings , which is just in the way that i 've been doing , in my school , i 've been doing it through my
i 'm in a <unknown> , i was a <unknown> <unknown> of my first woman who was a <unknown> woman .
and since we 've been in the first time for over six months , and i 've been doing it to work with her , and i 've got back to the <unknown> .
so , that means we started to build a new relationship with this .
and because i also have a bunch of other things that are also different from each other , and a lot of other things that have changed the other thing .
a lot i 've been doing is a lot of money i 've been doing .
i was with my family back to my family , and i was beginning to my school in the real time , and i started building the education in education , and i was working on the center of education .
so i work in my own today , i work to say , `` i call the word `` <unknown> '' i say , `` i call , '' i 'm going to say .
i just dismiss a <unknown> to the <unknown> , which is just a <unknown> <unknown> .
you really need to realize that there are very , very many people have been , but for example , i 've been able to do that for the time , but i really have to be , right , i do n't know , <unknown> engagement from people .
i 'm grateful i 'm grateful that you 've got on the idea at the idea that they 've done what they do .
i 'm grateful for you to have a problem of security , but i 'm very thankful to believe in a lot of that , and i 'm extremely grateful i could have to be part of it .
and of course , of course , the whole people who are able to support who are the ones who are helping us who are able to do that , and the people who are actually using this in the way that we were .
i talked to many people in the meantime , and i talked to you , and i always have always <unknown> myself , that 's good for you to make it .
and so i 'm going to do that , i 'm going to do it , and i think we can do it , and i think it 's a lot of it .
i 'm saying i 'm going to tell you about all .
come from prison .
and each of them has something that we need to do .
whether you 're going to have our participants in your <unknown> , whether you 're going to be a <unknown> , you know , if you 're going to be a more <unknown> of us , if you 're in a financial standpoint .
if you want to wear our new <unknown> , a <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> .
talk to talk about how to play .
martin <unknown> and i was here today . here 's where you are today here today .
and so we 're talking about the conversation with them .
thank you very much .
<unknown> <unknown> , i 've been <unknown> to <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> for <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> in nepal , <unknown> <unknown> in mexico .
in a time where i was a little bit more <unknown> , and i was a little <unknown> of a <unknown> .
you know that , you know , things you do , and you do like things like this .
for example , for <unknown> , i need to replace coalition coalition .
the game is going to go to the <unknown> .
a meeting of the brain is <unknown> accepting a <unknown> .
there 's actually a lot of ways of ways of ways of ways of ways that can be able to do with <unknown> devices , and you can have a <unknown> template with <unknown> .
but as you like to use it as much as it can be done with the way .
anyway , i was also <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
with my work and so , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> with the <unknown> .
so , i really really want to talk to <unknown> <unknown> .
not from real problems .
my problem was i was <unknown> , and i was really quite a little bit of a <unknown> , and i 'm really quite a very good picture of my life my life in 10 20 years ago , and a half years will look at a decade ago .
it was <unknown> .
and i found that this <unknown> <unknown> , i found frightening , right ?
to ensure that at least , i think , to summarize , even the positive analogy .
basically , i had a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
talk like private and the way that we 're private ,
i just did n't know how to do i take the <unknown> path further away ?
so , just i 'm just going to be easy to you ?
or what if i was to take my <unknown> <unknown> ?
and look what happens , what happens is that happens .
what they 're doing is saying , `` well , '' waiting for me .
these were the idea of the idea .
i was in this time , i was free <unknown> in <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> on a <unknown> .
like , `` <unknown> '' reviewed .
the <unknown> <unknown> was a <unknown> <unknown> , for me , he was also <unknown> at the <unknown> <unknown> of the absolute <unknown> .
you 're <unknown> free for the world 's energy in very good hotels , and <unknown> <unknown> the country into a very practical way , and so in a way , and how many ways you can do .
but also , very quickly , but also , very convenient countries also <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
developing countries , it may be more likely to see and say , as a <unknown> villages , there 's a <unknown> of <unknown> <unknown> with some other people who are n't known as though , but successful marriages .
right now , these images are <unknown> , but <unknown> lives are a <unknown> place , and it 's a different way of a way to also like it .
and that was exactly for me , and i was just to make a long time of a <unknown> .
i was what i was doing something to me .
on the left .
and also , i found it a little bit of a <unknown> of trying to write a little bit of a few of me to give me a few days of a little bit , i do n't really know what it was n't right in the country .
i wanted to change this .
i wanted to get the private countries .
to paraphrase <unknown> , can be writing paper articles .
and to make my personal interest in jazz .
how do you learn the better world ?
by seeking people to live with people .
in the people , living in the way , people 's home to go home .
not in the hotel .
by seeking about the challenges and with the problems of people , are preoccupied with the problems of people , and they 're dealing with the problems .
and by talking about it , you work with the people .
at least , the answer that i could be able to give up to ask the question .
and that wanted to do .
i also also wanted to do something that i wanted to do with something that 's a really fun thing .
i wanted to make a <unknown> .
something good , right ?
and this sense of self has me stymied for me , and i 've been photographing myself , and i 've been <unknown> myself , and i think , <unknown> , and i 'm going to go back to the <unknown> , and i 've been doing it ,
i was only in many years of the most interesting but more recently in the most recent years ago , i 've been able to pinpoint a lot of makeup .
until the <unknown> civil wars , there 's a <unknown> civil war , and there 's a lot of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of years , but also thousands of economic growth , and also developing countries , and social problems left .
with a annual kilometers of <unknown> dollars of <unknown> dollars , 1968 , nepal is a u.s. country , the poorest country in south america is south asia , in the country , in southern north america , in southern north america , in the country , in southern north america , in the country , in the country , in the country , in the country , in the country , in the country , in the country
and the thing is , until the thing , to continue to one of the poorest poorest countries in the world , the world 's population .
a quarter of the population of the population is going to live outside the scale of poverty and the amount of land in the planet is going to be a place .
almost one-fifth of a population of the population is about malnutrition , in malnutrition .
forty percent of the adults can not read and write writing and write writing .
all these facts are linked to a very personal stories and experiences that i witnessed in my journey was in my time , and was a <unknown> ,
in the way i wanted to change the way to do , to change myself .
and then i was then given to this point where i was doing , when i was in my mind , i 've been <unknown> my decision to make my decision , i 've got my decision .
i quit my job .
and i was thinking about the <unknown> in the aid .
and i 'm just going to be a <unknown> , and i 'm just going to be a <unknown> of the answer that i received on my job .
because she just was a <unknown> , a surprise of <unknown> .
it 's about a design that 's a really <unknown> to a international international company , which is a great international revolution .
and not to see a <unknown> <unknown> for a <unknown> <unknown> that wants to look at a time in time , and you 're going to be a <unknown> of your home .
hello ?
is it still going to be ?
my mission was really serious about this , and good , and good for me , and so good .
at least at the end , i thought that was at the end of the end of the thought , and i thought that was the same time , i thought ,
and the answer was a <unknown> <unknown> .
i was really <unknown> .
and then , of course , `` well , '' he 's emotional , '' in fact , a pretty emotional response written written about this .
and fortunately , never , <unknown> never <unknown> .
instead , i was doing this very weak feeling of making meaning as good as a good way of making <unknown> <unknown> .
i used it as a motor to make a open to make my own business .
<unknown> .
finally <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
a company is basically that a kind of thing that basically is just what i 've been looking at now , and what i 've been looking at .
so , the possibility is that , when you can , to take a country out of traveling a country differently .
the possibility to get a chance to know about a country , you know , to live in a country .
by working with the people that live in life and work , and work can happen .
and not only can happen somewhere else , but it can work on , but in the end of the <unknown> , i can work in the same way , and i can actually do it in the end of the brain .
so , you can click it on a way to put in the way to a lot of <unknown> , because of the way , you can click on two words in the way you can see .
so , <unknown> and <unknown> .
that means that the way that means that the way that you 're doing good , which is able to make good intervention with sound .
in fact , you can do good things like this .
now this sounds quickly <unknown> a little bit more <unknown> slightly more complicated .
but it 's not . but it 's not .
<unknown> is a social <unknown> business .
we use a lot of technology for using technology for sustainable development development .
now , we use a use of sustainable development for a tool for sustainable development for sustainable development , using the technology for sustainable development , and we can use it possible for sustainable development for sustainable technology , and we can use it possible for sustainable development for sustainable technology , and we use it to use technology to use technology for the use of sustainable development for the way that we use .
so , <unknown> , <unknown> and <unknown> .
because the people who are able to do with us , we can deliver a <unknown> while they 're <unknown> to their own media .
they pay for them to be able to pay attention to their journey , like the other <unknown> , and the other <unknown> ,
but it just starts different .
they live in <unknown> .
and the desire is n't really much more than a sudden , or if you 're not going to do a lot of catastrophe , and you 're not going to work in a lot of <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
social commitment .
<unknown> <unknown> .
so our students are <unknown> for us to have the <unknown> and interests in the projects and work in different projects in different projects .
we can use through our work to a <unknown> increase in the <unknown> market that otherwise otherwise , the other had n't had any chance of a product improvement .
because just the way to do that , because the only infrastructure is missing the risk of the infrastructure , is that it 's missing .
for other , we can use some projects projects like to create a lot of projects that we can do .
we can start to take a sustainable way to start with a sustainable way , and we use it to a whole new way of thinking , and we 've made it for a way of belief that we 've been using it .
so we 're using a hundred percent of a thousand percent self itself .
we do n't have no capacity to kill themselves .
and that 's just for our social <unknown> experience of meaning .
so , we started with our work at <unknown> work in nepal , and we have a <unknown> in berlin .
<unknown> year , we 've got our engagement on uganda , and we have our engagement on uganda .
and over the last few years , i 've been thinking , and i 've been married and i 've been married , and i was a man and i 've been a second , a person , a new question question .
do we go to the <unknown> way on the way ?
or what if we think about thinking about thinking about it ?
if we 're going to keep the <unknown> at the time ?
if we do n't have only social social and sustainable , but sustainable , but also , is it possible to <unknown> the <unknown> in the wholeness ?
and then the way that the individual <unknown> <unknown> ?
or even more advanced <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
and then , this would basically be a new way of a company company , and then , it would have a partnership company .
a company that makes you to create businesses .
but in other words , there 's a good philosophy of <unknown> , and the same philosophy of <unknown> , like <unknown> , <unknown> .
do n't want to do that ?
the next question .
<unknown> new <unknown> companies ?
so we may feel that .
we love entrepreneurs and we have creative , and how creative businesses .
because we 're <unknown> , because we 're <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> .
because we 're talking about the same language .
because we made the same dreams .
because we think that we think about the challenges .
and so that 's why we have a <unknown> in this year , and i 've been a <unknown> in a sister .
<unknown> .
and with <unknown> , we use creative businesses , we 're using creative businesses in their development and <unknown> <unknown> that we are using social support of us .
we 're using the participants , entrepreneurs , entrepreneurs , or , from a creative , with the creative companies with local development with their development ,
so , the <unknown> of the social social and <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> <unknown> has been <unknown> , and the <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> is coming out .
and <unknown> that 's focused on the <unknown> .
there 's also a lot of time for <unknown> , and again , again , <unknown> again .
a <unknown> of the camera is a little bit of a <unknown> <unknown> that has given a huge amount of errors .
he shows a very simple little time of where time you can or or you can <unknown> .
now , if you might have a <unknown> <unknown> , there may be <unknown> <unknown> .
now , if you might have to play too much , you can be able to play in a way of <unknown> , thinking about <unknown> , but in the way , you know , in the way , you know , in the way , you know , in the way , you know , you know , in the way , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
and he shows what she looks at a moment to make you very good at all .
a <unknown> is a <unknown> website .
it 's the creativity , and the creativity , suddenly , the suddenly , the suddenly , is suddenly a great thing .
or it 's because the <unknown> <unknown> you found in new york is a <unknown> in this .
the <unknown> things you do n't want to do that , you can not change the way to do n't change .
and the force of the things that change is to change the way that you can change .
and you can do a much more change .
in a short time , in short short time .
we know that .
an example of a sudden , i think , is a example of a <unknown> .
these are <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> .
that 's five wonderful beautiful women from uganda to be a very dead number of uganda .
with <unknown> , and with <unknown> , with talent and with talent .
they also found beautiful , <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> years years years ago .
and years ago , nothing happened .
because they just did n't have a market for this .
because they did n't know how they could use the quality of money .
because nobody told him no one who said , `` what 's going to ask , `` design '' would be coming , you know , what design is going to ask you , '' and what 's going to ask you , `` well , '' is supposed to be asked .
we wanted to help these women .
so , in fact , there 's been a <unknown> project that has been a <unknown> project that we 've been building a year ago .
<unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
products that people are going to be different from the poverty .
they give a income a day .
we can help make a future .
we 've been yesterday yesterday , and we went back to our <unknown> forests .
and we start with a pretty <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
a <unknown> <unknown> of thousands of dollars from a <unknown> of the women of our women .
the titanium does not only take you to a income , you ca n't feed a $ $ income per year .
but also , also also , it also allows us to make a lot larger bigger than a long larger .
this first <unknown> is a social media is social social <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> in one of the <unknown> .
so , the support want to help , can allow this to make a 401 plan for the hand , but you can also do it to the same time , and then we can also go to the <unknown> .
it can continue to grow women and travel to <unknown> , and you can <unknown> them , and they 're going to be active .
we 're not going to have to do n't just a lot of a child , we 're not going to be a child , but you can take a family or a car or a family or a hundred or a hundred .
and it 's not just in uganda , but in fact , in 2005 , in 2005 , in 2005 , in the other course of the <unknown> that we 're working on with the <unknown> of work .
but this is the <unknown> of the <unknown> , but this <unknown> <unknown> only only a project from our collective cycle of projects .
we work in all the most areas of work in the central areas of the world .
in the area , <unknown> and health and health and <unknown> and <unknown> and <unknown> and <unknown> and <unknown> and <unknown> and <unknown> and <unknown> and <unknown> and <unknown> and <unknown> and <unknown> .
because the work is only just a little bit of a scale , just like a little bit different , just a little bit different .
what happens to the kids with the children when the children work work ?
right .
so we 've been in this year in this year in nepal , and in uganda , we 've been two to the two <unknown> centre .
everything all walks into our dna <unknown> .
and the whole thing is more ways to make a sense of every single project , which is a single project for itself .
so , we 're actually entering the <unknown> in the different projects , the only way that we 've been doing in the different projects .
the same possibility of reference , then they 're only starting in the common work of the future .
and at the end , i want to leave you to right now directly directly on a journey .
and i 'm going to give you to close your eyes to the end .
now , you 're going to be aware of you .
in the heart of uganda , in uganda , uganda are about 15 .
you 're at a <unknown> bedroom . you 're sitting on a <unknown> bedroom .
and <unknown> and <unknown> and <unknown> .
you 've just chosen to swim with your <unknown> <unknown> to the <unknown> .
there were <unknown> <unknown> .
<unknown> .
tasty .
the walls are <unknown> .
there 's it <unknown> , it 's <unknown> warm .
you 're <unknown> from the window . you 're leaving out of the window .
and the kids <unknown> on the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
their <unknown> feet <unknown> the sand of the sand .
you <unknown> <unknown> your car .
and you can also think of a funny layer of a <unknown> layer of the game , and you can see , you know , there 's a <unknown> layer of the <unknown> test .
the children laugh , laugh , laugh , laugh , laugh , laugh .
and call out of the names .
you 're going to tell you that you 're not going to just buy anything more <unknown> anymore .
<unknown> .
you do n't know how much it was .
but soon , soon you 'll get up to the end of the shoes .
and the <unknown> , who are still working on children , the kids were <unknown> , <unknown> .
at the end of the street , a <unknown> tree is a big tree .
you 're going to be able to leave you with <unknown> with you .
in the anthropologist , in the favela of the redwood forest , you 're going to go to the new <unknown> of your car , and you want to design the new design of your <unknown> .
as they always want to go to the hands and they talk about hands and hands .
so , later , later , other people think of the other women , and then , if you were able to get out of the women .
it smile you smile you 're <unknown> you <unknown> .
so if you 're going to leave you with your <unknown> <unknown> .
underneath the tree .
in free .
incredible , there 's a big deal of the sunlight here yet .
you put in tomorrow , you put back to your coach .
you can tell you about this thing that you 're doing .
the exchange is all worth of value , and the exchange is clear .
and also , it 's also too much to talk about languages b to talk to a german .
you 're reading music . you 're dancing music .
and the <unknown> <unknown> of <unknown> .
mom 's <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> in the courtyard the <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> <unknown> .
she sings a social song .
you 're happy , happy and happy .
you can move your eyes back to the same time .
and each of us can be able to make <unknown> , and we can actually make a <unknown> <unknown> to something new <unknown> .
or at least a long time , at least a long time , to breathe , quickly , to breathe again , and again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again ,
and what happens is , what happens to happen .
thank you .
before i start to work , i would be interested in whether you 're here today , you 've been here , you 've got a <unknown> <unknown> back here .
i do n't know that with the light , i do n't really good at the light , but maybe you want to leave you somebody on your eyes .
here , here , i 'm going to be somebody wearing this guy .
two .
here 's not a <unknown> , i do n't have to say , but on the case there is a few minutes , and that 's beautiful , we 're just a <unknown> to the <unknown> .
i also have a <unknown> , and it was also a building , and the <unknown> <unknown> discovered the mountain mountain mountain in the east of the city , the <unknown> of the city , and the <unknown> of the city is <unknown> .
this is the building .
together with 20 days of mine , i 've been able to get the <unknown> <unknown> last year six months ago .
so i 'm going to talk about this story here today .
so , maybe , some of you may say , some of you might say , `` maybe now , perhaps now , maybe now , perhaps maybe you might say , `` maybe now , maybe maybe you might say , `` maybe now , maybe maybe you might say , `` maybe now , maybe you might say , `` maybe now , maybe you might say , `` maybe now , maybe you might say ,
what is it ?
there are many of them .
but i 'd like to explain it briefly , i 'm going to explain it briefly .
well , what , you think about , what 's now the <unknown> is the <unknown> ?
and so , so , you know , you <unknown> the park , you know , how about the park , or how do you do it in the park , and how ?
just a little sample of questions that we think about , friends , colleagues , as you 've learned , that i 've been able to share with a initiative that i 've been doing , is a <unknown> name , <unknown> <unknown> .
all of us , we were able to put ourselves into the series of <unknown> <unknown> , who we had a <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> .
and so , as you were looking at these <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> are able to put them baskets .
and to search for the liberation of the <unknown> of the <unknown> , which is <unknown> , and it 's like the <unknown> , and it 's <unknown> .
but who knows me who knows that , this is not my way of the <unknown> .
and it was also not the <unknown> <unknown> of the initiative .
what we see here is a sign from the <unknown> <unknown> of <unknown> , and in <unknown> , <unknown> .
this is a public space that 's just private , and therefore many people are not to be , say , but not just in public hand , but that 's not being used to be able to be able to use public spaces .
we were a group of <unknown> <unknown> , and we were using <unknown> <unknown> in the desire with <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> , to <unknown> , sustainable , to use it , and also use it to humanitarian problems .
and we wanted to tell a different <unknown> story .
we were a <unknown> team , and we have to be able to actually take this very quickly , but it was a very <unknown> team .
from the nature of the art , <unknown> social -- politics -- and <unknown> -- <unknown> , <unknown> , design , music , music , music , <unknown> , <unknown> and <unknown> .
of course , at all , with different social cultural and personal <unknown> and personal <unknown> , and so on the same time , the way we 've been doing .
our perspectives , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , and <unknown> <unknown> .
and we also have to take us to use other kinds of different skills , but also , different colors of social networks .
and the more important thing to do is , for a problem , we have a very important solutions in the <unknown> that we 've been doing , and we 've actually <unknown> to <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
we actually actually have to come to the <unknown> , and we actually put the <unknown> on the <unknown> .
however , it was about the following thing that we were talking about the <unknown> with stories and ideas together .
we asked people to ask and images like wondering , and images , asked how to do some pictures .
and from these memories and images , trying to develop different perspectives for the <unknown> .
and it was important to think about the process , the process is always moving into a process , and it 's really available to us .
we 're just as a initiative that we 're always even thinking of as a <unknown> and a <unknown> platform , and as we found a <unknown> , and <unknown> <unknown> .
so , a <unknown> and a <unknown> and emotional and <unknown> and went on and he was looking at a <unknown> .
and the experience that we did is , i 've done , i 've been doing , i 've been doing , i 'm going to be doing now , i 'm going to go to the <unknown> today , and i 'm going to go back to the moment today .
every city of <unknown> <unknown> .
the other hand is a face that give the face .
in many cases , these were all the <unknown> and <unknown> , and they were going to be the same of women , and they are in the number of women , as well as adults ,
you 're the dead places of a city , because they 're not often the ones that they 're not likely to be able to see what we 're going to do in the public space .
for example , for example , we 've talked about , we 've got <unknown> , we have <unknown> , we have a <unknown> , <unknown> , and we 've got <unknown> .
and then these are , but also , actually , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , the very powerful thing that 's going to be built in urban places , it will often be a lot of <unknown> , and that 's often <unknown> .
initiatives that allow your initiatives to be able to return those places , they often have been interested in <unknown> , often work very much in the participation .
what it was doing with this thing to do is to do , i want to ask a few questions , like some of the earth , i want to ask a few questions .
i mean , a lot of them .
and the places that we do n't see in the city , not only a face of the city , not only a face .
no .
they are the social places that our new york system that we 're going to do is to change our life lives in life , and we 're going to be living in life , and we 're going to be able to live in our life life .
so we 're going to take a first bunch of <unknown> to our neighbors , if we 've <unknown> ourselves to the way to the <unknown> , to the end of the <unknown> , we can get to the <unknown> .
and can this swim , if we 've got a design opportunity to sit , and we can continue to think about where the rivers are also <unknown> .
and we 've been <unknown> <unknown> silently to each much .
and together , these are many groups , often , sometimes , sometimes .
but with security , it 's a sense of community .
the more i 've been doing in this public space , and i think about the public space , and the way it is also the way that we have , and that 's how this community also did .
and if i do n't get me to get a <unknown> , then you 'll see what you 're going to call the <unknown> of a great commercial .
we were then two challenges that we 've got two to a problem .
we can be able to use the laws of freedom and responsibility and dedication for their own food , or the <unknown> <unknown> will also be <unknown> .
how does seymour trash in common changes in creation ?
how could <unknown> be ideas in ideas ?
<unknown> against the physics and <unknown> of these <unknown> , <unknown> and <unknown> of those <unknown> , and <unknown> , who are significantly against the fact that it 's not even more effective , and not even <unknown> , just <unknown> the same places .
now , imagine that you 're sitting here , you just put the newspaper on the front row , they 're going to take the newspaper on the newspaper , and read pictures text .
love <unknown> and citizens , we 're going to make you a lot of possible ways for the <unknown> of the <unknown> of the <unknown> , and it has been <unknown> by a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
you can also argue that by the answer is that a representation is an application .
and the amount of problems with most of the <unknown> <unknown> is going to happen in most of the most <unknown> , and then we 've been able to do it in the future .
would you go ?
would anyone who you spend on the conference ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds just great fun .
there 's a lot of ways of opportunity that can <unknown> the <unknown> .
they can get <unknown> , as they can <unknown> <unknown> like the same way , and in the future .
and as i said , sounds , great , just , i 'm just great about the first time .
i just decided to experiment in some explanation .
and that 's because i think that you 're not going to do n't really believe you 're really not just going to be able to do n't really want to do n't really want to do n't really want to do n't really want to do n't really want to do n't really want to do n't just look at the moment , or you can do or you can do n't think or be a virtual ,
first of course , because of the <unknown> , classical <unknown> <unknown> often often <unknown> much more <unknown> .
it 's , you know , there 's no opportunity to make a very good way to do to do the very simple and <unknown> alternatives , but there 's actually a design design , and you can not have to make <unknown> , or if you 're <unknown> or <unknown> into the urban green plants .
or , as a friend , as a friend , what color color is for example .
second funny <unknown> is <unknown> <unknown> 's about the data about information and <unknown> .
think about three <unknown> statistics .
we have to what we 've got to here here , and we have to show you , and you can also be able to keep them and you can also be able to keep them up .
frustration and <unknown> and many are often the consequences of what i think is actually think of think about .
i do n't want to give you a decision about <unknown> , or <unknown> , if i actually do n't have a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
but also , it 's also different .
although even the <unknown> of the <unknown> of the <unknown> of the <unknown> of the <unknown> of the most prolific learning would have learned a lot of time , we 've been discussing a lot of <unknown> , and then we 've learned to have much more sophisticated <unknown> .
and so we 've been able to share some of the experiences and so i want to share with the same time to make sure for other <unknown> data .
i want to encourage it to other initiatives , in other projects , but in the way , and i think , and most of all the things that are and the politics and the politics .
because the people who are the ones that would be able to do the <unknown> effect of the brain , and they 're really responsible for these kinds of processes .
and what 's really interested in a lot is about a lot of how many of these are the number of <unknown> and <unknown> , we need to take and get the new opportunity to the planet .
i do n't think i have n't <unknown> me , but i think i 'm going to be able to do that you 're sitting here in your life you 're sitting here today .
so that 's because because i 'm very <unknown> for a very important way to think about it .
i 'm going to do it for doubt that you 're going to go all , and i want to encourage you to take them with our example , to give you a chance of <unknown> , and the <unknown> <unknown> gives another chance to give you another opportunity .
and i start to think of all of this , because these are the ones that can be able to do with the new <unknown> , and that 's a <unknown> <unknown> .
so we have to look at the way that comes to look at the laws of being aware of violence and responsibility for their own <unknown> and discussions of kindness and <unknown> to participation <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> ?
first of all , when you kill a lot of living on the <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> .
in <unknown> , in the most part of the <unknown> , i 'm involved in the brain , and the citizens of the <unknown> , and they 're in their own family and different interests , and so many patients are going to happen .
what we see here is a <unknown> that we 've invited to join .
what we see here is some of the <unknown> , and <unknown> of the conversation with the conversation with autism share with : and i have the conversation with the future with autism .
the goal must be that all the things that are happening on <unknown> , so that means that the most <unknown> interests or the skills of the <unknown> is the <unknown> community of the leaders , and the <unknown> skills of the leaders of the leaders .
the citizens of the place are experts , they 're experts in their homes , they know what they are missing , which is a <unknown> , and put together in a place where the divine one is a place and what they 're doing is
the <unknown> , especially , in the city , can be able to do what 's going to do with the city , which is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
in , in a certain way , if you have a certain way of <unknown> , the <unknown> will be <unknown> , the only thing we 've been on is the project that is just like the project , the first time is , after the first time , the way we 've ever lost in the project .
this is all trying to a <unknown> where a whole thing for all of the information for all of these information is , and then the way that will be going to be the place to be a place for the place .
by perhaps , sometimes , you can be able to get the headache that can be able to get a candle of the place , and then you can get a certain kind of thing , and then it can be a <unknown> of the place .
a recent thing about <unknown> is also that the players who actually actually are being made of the <unknown> , and the <unknown> of the things are actually becoming more serious .
and then again , if someone says , i want to say , i want to take a <unknown> <unknown> next to the <unknown> .
this can be done by a lot of <unknown> , but the goal has to be done in the same way , with all of the <unknown> , which is the right solution and perhaps in the <unknown> , but perhaps in the other hand , but maybe in a while
as i said , `` well , i said , `` well , this is what we 've got to do , i 've got to get out of the experiments .
second , many of them are kind of a lot of different types of <unknown> species .
our <unknown> is all the pieces of sensors , and we have all these pieces of sensors .
one feels a lot of being perceived if you 're going to be a <unknown> group of india , and talk about something .
another thing is good for a good news to do not really good at the moment , not just text of <unknown> <unknown> .
other people may not be able to do it or do it , and they 're able to do it , and i think it 's a way of a <unknown> or a while , and i could do it in a way , and i could do it in a moment , and i could n't do it in a way , and i could do it in a moment , and i could n't do it in
or they put their ideas in <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
what i want to say is to have to take it to be a lot of <unknown> <unknown> to be different different kinds of social media projects .
we 've got to say that one thing is , one of the ways of being able to come to be there , but to go back to what 's happened .
in the background , small eye show this exhibition , a small exhibition show you .
we have the opportunity to have the opportunity to give <unknown> <unknown> .
we 've had the possibility to start to paint , and i 'd like , to draw this way .
we had the opportunity to write the opportunity to write a plan to write .
from the age of the age .
this was a <unknown> girl .
we had the ability to try to make our ability to connect our ideas with a little bit of a little bit more ideas to play ideas , and we can play with a ideas .
also , the way to help the extent of <unknown> <unknown> is to be difficult to be difficult to have to be lost , should be to be paid .
this is what we can do is about a <unknown> of a <unknown> , which can happen to be <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
the <unknown> and transparent availability of the results that are based on a dialogue that 's based on a <unknown> , which is the <unknown> under the <unknown> .
we even have the whole process of facebook , facebook , and on a very <unknown> of my blog , and at the news that we were doing , and that 's why they have a <unknown> data from a <unknown> .
our third point of <unknown> .
you may remember that i knew that <unknown> would often work far too much time .
in my <unknown> event , i had been <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
<unknown> is the process of being a <unknown> , and then , as a spring , and what 's been working on and the fact that you 're not going to see , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you do n't know , you know , you ca n't know , you know , you ca n't
when you 're going to do that , and so i 'm going to go back to the one of the time , and then we 're going to be <unknown> , which are <unknown> in the area of the area of the area .
and the one of the time , after example , the first one of the time has also <unknown> the <unknown> self itself , and also , even though , even though , too <unknown> , even though .
and then when , in the beginning , the world is that the <unknown> <unknown> event and so forth , but it was just looking at the experience of previous attacks .
what happens now , when people are going to get their citizens from <unknown> and their families are <unknown> .
it 's already in the first place to see about 12 projects .
i 've had a example of a <unknown> of <unknown> , which is the <unknown> <unknown> , is probably the <unknown> , is probably about many of them here , probably probably in many of you here , many of them here are probably in many of these things .
in new york , a project came out , and we 've been a project that was published , and it was a project that was about a project , and it 's about a <unknown> .
in <unknown> <unknown> , there 's four months of <unknown> <unknown> , and there are the <unknown> of the possible possible to be able to do it , or at least <unknown> .
the time it has been in the chicago , and the industry could n't have no different way to make sure that they do n't mean to make their idea of their own .
but the most important in the middle of the new york , which i do n't know about to say , because he 's going to be a given to the most important of the world 's greatest <unknown> in the city , not just an idea of politics or the
in the contrary , the <unknown> , the <unknown> <unknown> for the <unknown> party were <unknown> , and in the same time , i 've been <unknown> , and then on the same time , i think ,
in <unknown> , so we 're back to germany , we 've been back to germany , and the citizens who have been found the tumors plans for the <unknown> of a place , and we 've won a lot of <unknown> to the ground .
the city had been a <unknown> , and it was n't even <unknown> , and then he did n't need to make it .
the four weeks of <unknown> , who we 've been doing for <unknown> <unknown> , who are <unknown> in the same time , and the rich completely different from the <unknown> .
today 's the <unknown> today that the <unknown> <unknown> project is about <unknown> city .
while the <unknown> of <unknown> <unknown> wonderfully wonderful , and the city of the <unknown> , the <unknown> that the women who have started , and the other <unknown> of the <unknown> , and other other <unknown> .
so , in fact , the <unknown> , in the fact , the local <unknown> has their own <unknown> on the street .
in a situation , in a <unknown> , a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
all right , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , you 're going to say , well , you want to say .
but we just just keep moving away , so let 's go out so far , so let 's just go so well , so let 's go so well , so let 's go so well , so we 're now going to go so far away .
but i think it 's a little bit wrong to wrong to the city of the responsibility .
why ?
for a way , because you think , because you have a look for it or have solved .
while the algorithm , they 're going to be the ability to make the <unknown> or to the <unknown> of them in a form of human being , the city of the role of the patient 's role for the <unknown> for the <unknown> for the <unknown> , and the <unknown>
and for example , even though other people have the same time as a projects that works to work , other people are going to be there , other other people are available .
a <unknown> health initiative , this is a only <unknown> initiative , which is just just <unknown> <unknown> .
and our goal was a constant initiative that was given to a legacy that was given to her visit , and it was about a million years ago that would really want to get the work of the work of the media and the responsibility to the city .
but the first time , the first time has been a <unknown> <unknown> that had bought the <unknown> in the hills .
there are still a bunch of other things .
so , unfortunately , we 've got the problem with the moment that we have n't had to have the <unknown> , and we have n't able to do not yet to have the <unknown> issue on the problem .
but we know that , in fact , when the city <unknown> the <unknown> <unknown> , if the dictators are still successful , then they 're going to be a <unknown> , and that <unknown> is going to be a
what the universe is happening is just a open configuration , but it 's open up here .
to get to the end of this , i 've been convinced that many projects that are being given by your meaning , and also , your body from the city has to be a patient 's peaceful , and <unknown> .
if you just just go back and work in time , in the clinical trials , you 're going to be able to get to the leadership of the public , you know , and i 'm going to be able to help you work on the pursuit of the public ,
in the city of the city and citizens , and citizens , and citizens , and citizens , and citizens , and citizens , and citizens , and citizens , and citizens , and citizens , and citizens , and citizens , and so citizens , and so forth .
in the way , for a whole bunch of days , and you all do you , you 're sitting here tonight now .
if we demand our very very serious and even the research , the research that are the most <unknown> of the citizens of the citizens of the citizens of the citizens of the citizens , not as a result of the citizens , not as a result of the weight , but as a <unknown> .
that 's it .
yesterday , after the night , we were in the middle of the <unknown> , and we were in a <unknown> in <unknown> in the <unknown> and the <unknown> , and then we 've got to the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
we talked to talk about <unknown> <unknown> .
so this idea of having to think about this idea , another thing that we have had to do in this life , if it has n't been in the life , it just <unknown> the second time , and even the second opportunity gives us a chance .
we thought , interesting , we thought , exciting , exciting , we 've been talked about this idea .
and we 've been relatively quickly , we 're going to have a lot of things that we have to do two things we did n't want to experience even more .
one of the one hand is the meeting invitation .
the second thing was , then , when the other thing was , when the other <unknown> was the same time on the table at the school time , when you start to school ?
no .
no way . no .
school , some of you may remember , <unknown> may not <unknown> out of the <unknown> .
so , i 'm so now , now , the <unknown> years of coming , but the words are starting to me to sleep in front of hands , and i 'm hoping to me to make hands together .
my neck <unknown> <unknown> me and i just just go back to the <unknown> .
and then i do n't know how it was in the trial , but in my test , then he had been <unknown> the <unknown> , who was the same time looking at me .
no idea what does n't have been done in the way that 's actually going to be really done .
they will understand it , so my colleague was n't beautiful , and then i first had my last <unknown> behind me , i had n't even sure , even before , and i was never <unknown> myself .
and what i 'm going to say is , if i 'm going to go back to the year , i 've been <unknown> some of the most amazing dimensions of my favorite days i spent a life , which i spent in schools .
with very serious , and breadwinners , and very voluntary discipline , and they 're always getting poor , and they 're always getting sick in a way .
how did it come to ?
how could this happen ?
and so , just just started to imagine that something happened is that i could n't afford to do a little bit of what i could n't use before .
i got kids .
so my wife was getting sick of kids , and my wife 's kids .
and so , then , again , it 's also clear that it 's one that who had to do with the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
to the day when the one day when she said , `` it 's <unknown> , '' she says , `` it 's <unknown> , '' which is <unknown> .
now , you 're now going to go today today .
yes , <unknown> .
and i was the <unknown> , and i opened the door , and then i was sitting there in the <unknown> , and i was so in this kind of <unknown> and <unknown> , i felt so <unknown> myself , i felt <unknown> <unknown> in the <unknown> .
this was exactly how it looked like it was a way to look back to us in the time , as we looked like us .
and the <unknown> also was like like school as well as well as well , and i 'm going to give me a person out of the news , and i 'm sure that there 's real pain .
and then i heard the teacher say , and you know , kids have n't learn for school , but for life , i 'm going to say , my god , i 've never been able to give me a
what 's what we 've done from school , in this study , really , have this early first life for life , and i 've been trying to make this work for life ?
so many of us have learned that they learned to make well that well , really , they 've been working well well on the same time .
where do you have a really good place in your life , you can have the best possible thing to get your good news ?
and maybe some of you know , some of the time , some of the ways of the <unknown> is called <unknown> .
what is even more jews ?
or <unknown> , this ability within a lot of knowledge for a lot of knowledge , just by the way that i can <unknown> it back to a <unknown> , until i 'm a bad ?
all right , i 've been doing it for the <unknown> , but i 've been doing for the <unknown> , but pardon it ?
and what does a mean a <unknown> of a one of the first one of you in terms of someone else is going to be a good doctor ?
whether the <unknown> is the feeling and is the good <unknown> of traits that you have done ?
no .
so , drink , it 's a matter of life , it 's like to teach us for school , and we 're learning to school .
if we look back to the <unknown> , so about <unknown> years , the middle of the world , that 's why they 've been <unknown> .
this is time that the time in germany is in the <unknown> , and the <unknown> was actually found in a <unknown> , and in the end of the first time , was found in a <unknown> .
and where the school system that we think about the school system , as we 've been going to have today , the roots has already .
and if we think about time , then , in fact , it was all the people who did n't have access to the time , because the people have n't have access to know that they were already aware of the time .
and there were these four or six years , which they were forced to go to school and to know , and they were the only opportunity to have the only thing that had the thing to do with the knowledge and the
today , a <unknown> <unknown> is more information in his pocket than the largest library of the time , and the largest library of the time .
and the middle of the <unknown> century , which was the time of <unknown> .
that means that there 's some changes in the world , and there are suddenly people who need to have people who could put this new machines .
but the same thing that they needed to have was needed to have people who need to have these machines to wait and those machines could wait to be able to measure and make it all the <unknown> , and we can measure the <unknown> .
and we needed people who were trying to make these machines that were these machines , and those who were playing these these jobs and those who were running these facilities .
maybe you may have seen it .
the <unknown> school that we 've been doing in germany is in a lot of germany , who 's a single time in his time , and the trick in this time .
and yet , perhaps , because it 's a lot of time .
but , because , because , it was probably really , because what i 've been working on school , i 've learned to be the work for the work of the work , and then i was in the <unknown> , who was in the <unknown> , who was in his life .
let 's do a look at the future .
let 's take the <unknown> century where it is , and so we 're looking at the year of the time .
the year <unknown> was the year was the first <unknown> <unknown> only briefly just briefly , and it was just a first <unknown> <unknown> , and in fact , in a way , he was a short <unknown> .
i was done with my research , and i thought , well , now , now , now , at the time , you 're going to make you all the way that you have to do the first company .
yes , after some of me , just like me , i was about , and i was reading the internet , i 'm going to be able to do it again , and i 'm going to do it again .
and some companies have been <unknown> us and have bigger and bigger , and we 're also so beautiful , and some of the companies have been <unknown> us down in the free , and <unknown>
you 're still going to have two days in life .
and we then had a lot of <unknown> , and we had a thousand people from a hundred years ago .
so , we had such a beautiful growth , and we had so passionate about this special projects on the <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
i do n't know if you have a <unknown> idea , which people do that , but i had a <unknown> in school , we did n't have a idea that what would be ever been able to give them what they would be like .
even when i was <unknown> , when i was <unknown> , what i did was <unknown> was exactly what i did n't know about what the internet was n't going to be a good thing .
and the kids that we 're now in school now is the privilege of what i 'm going to get in the school , are the millions of years , 10 , 20 , 20 or 20 years ?
the only thing that we have to do is the fact that we have to do is the only thing i mean , we have no idea of understanding that i have no idea .
and what knows what knowledge is to need to be successful in the future , will be successful in this future jobs ?
and if they 're honest , it 's the only answer , we have no idea of meaning , we have no idea .
and because we 're just going to do that in the future , i could find a lot of who i could use my <unknown> to the antelope .
there 's <unknown> <unknown> , i read reading .
well , look , you see , you 're seeing you 've seen a sense of that .
how do we get out what we 're going to learn to school school school ?
what are the things that we need to do for children to spend kids for life ?
and perhaps a kind of thing that is happening now is what kind of today today are <unknown> from adolescents are starving .
this is the thing that the most <unknown> of school , is that ?
the school of schools and universities and then come into the company , and then in the company , and then in the business , they have the u.n. , and then the way they 're doing , the way we have , the way we 've been doing .
and if you look at this <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , it 's a very clear idea of the fact that , because the way we have , so that , the way we 're doing .
and so , you want to say , so you read this , we 're going to go down , we 're <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> over 10 years , and about 12 years ago .
and that 's going to do research , and that 's not going to afford to do it , and also can not afford to afford it in the future .
but what 's the most personal but perhaps , what may be able to do is the things that are going to be important , and that 's why i think that 's the essence of the <unknown> , and i 'm convinced that these <unknown> <unknown>
and you can actually take the distinction in the groups of <unknown> groups , and in the groups , which is <unknown> within three groups ,
that 's the company , who 's the students who are choosing who have flexible worms , the flexible are so , so fast is that , if a <unknown> is that , if a <unknown> is that a bit of it .
and so , almost all of the teachers , the best wish to think of <unknown> , to think , <unknown> , think about <unknown> .
and then the company that would have the employees who were <unknown> who are <unknown> .
so we have a <unknown> , thinking about <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> .
let 's start with a little bit higher .
this is relatively fast , and so this is relatively quickly using the simple things .
if we look at how economics is how fast works , how fast all the way it works .
<unknown> , all of the models are going to be used from the internet of the world from the <unknown> of the day .
there are a company that i have to do with entrepreneurs who can be used with this change , and i can use it in this change .
there 's a company that i have to do is that i have a company who is a company who is a company that are creative as well as creative as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as
i have employees to give the <unknown> that are <unknown> .
that 's pretty much the opposite of what 's going to be in the factory end of the <unknown> century of employees , who had been used by the <unknown> .
the second thing is thinking about the long-term subject of thinking , is that clear , so that 's clear clear , but it 's clear clear , but also , is clear , is clear , so that 's clear , is because i think , is clear , is clear , so that 's clear , is that clear clear ,
it 's about responsibility .
there 's a lot of people who are going to take responsibility to the responsibility .
first of all , first of all , and your own life , and you 're living in your own life .
but for the big deal with the big deal .
whether or the thing that we 're doing is , that 's the company or the cure , we 're going to give people a human choice for the problem of the big deal of the big deal .
and the third thing that is the <unknown> factor , which is going to be almost <unknown> most likely to be <unknown> in the most important place .
and if we remember that <unknown> , '' in the internet , we 've been <unknown> on the internet , and there 's a beautiful question of thought that it was like , `` i 'm going to be this beautiful thought of it . ''
argentina has <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> , and germany has a team .
it was n't a <unknown> <unknown> that was the <unknown> <unknown> , which has won the <unknown> .
and so they could make a lot of things .
and so , somebody 's and so , the great innovator of our time , steve jobs , steve jobs , yes , <unknown> .
it was n't the thing that the <unknown> did have had the iphone , which did n't invented the <unknown> , which did n't have <unknown> <unknown> , who did n't invent .
and one had a team that did that possible , because we had to have a team to have a <unknown> , which had the thing they were doing what they were doing .
so , school school , who do the same thing to offer those three things to do , which is a very creative school , which we 're learning to live in life .
but there 's still <unknown> 2 , and again , there 's a second generation of the point , and the reason i 'm more important is more important than me .
and that 's also learning to yourself .
if the only thing we can say about the future of security is that it 's not sufficient to be in new ways , and fun to learn to learn the way that we 're in the future , and that our children are living in the future , and that our children are living in the future , and that our children are living in the future .
now , that 's what we 're doing for science , who are known to work with these kinds of things that we 've been doing this .
but where was i been wrong ?
i was in a <unknown> , and the way that you have kids who have that this is that this is not just a research that he was just doing adventure for a <unknown> for the <unknown> to be <unknown> .
so , joel was inspiring to the slogan of the devil all , but not all of all of us , and not even before everyone 's all ,
so , to the point where the <unknown> will be , because then suddenly , they 're all going to be able to move all the way up .
yes , i sat there , and what i 'm saying is , if i do n't know , if i had to say , if i do n't know , if i had to say , if i had to say , if i had to say , if i had to say , in the <unknown> of my children , those were the <unknown> parts of the event , i 've got the <unknown> parts of the
less of it was it for me as a while , when the <unknown> would find out of the <unknown> , to come to the subject of homework , and learn to all the work of the <unknown> of the life of life .
and so much fun , fun , if you 're sick , if the child is sick , because in school , in school , in school , <unknown> are <unknown> .
and finally , the <unknown> ended , and the <unknown> was a <unknown> of this <unknown> <unknown> at this school , and again , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
and it was n't really a <unknown> , so it was more like a <unknown> , so on the last hour and in the last hour , and in fact , we were the only parent that invited to write .
and i 'm going to tell you now and i 'm looking at the details of the time , because we have to have our child to <unknown> , that 's not .
but the most recent years of the two years ago , we 've got two years of where we have to have , not work .
what do we do wrong ? what really do we do wrong ?
and we actually actually had the question of being a question of our child 's <unknown> ?
and are we going to have the only thing that is it going to be ?
i 've been in the last two years , i 've been working in the subject to the part of my life , and i realized i needed to be a lot of time , you 're not alone .
there are many people who are similar to me , and it was two years ago , i was <unknown> with a new company , a few of us , we started thinking about how the journey there is , and night , we sat at the
and what i mean , i mean , he was almost told me the same story about a young story with his kids , and we had the lucky to us , and we had the idea that we could take our kids to this
in berlin , there 's a <unknown> model of different schools and a lot of other schools , and we could even have <unknown> cooperation in games .
but can we do it ?
somehow , it was a little bit more to try to make our kids ' security and make these <unknown> out of the time there were so much like the <unknown> out of how they are .
and after we 've got the evidence to school , i 've been able to have this kind of thing that we did n't think about it , we 're good , we 're the first thing to do the problem now .
it 's just how we can change the <unknown> <unknown> of any more ?
the good thing is that we 're a confession to suggest that we have to be afraid .
we do n't even alone alone .
but we 've got to be a quick deal with this kind of thing that 's very different from the great people who found what we thought , `` we can create a school community , who are going to create <unknown> , who are all <unknown> in the future .
it 's not so that the children and the parents are under the suffering , and their parents under the things that happened , which was a different thing that happened , and so there 's a lot of things that happened there .
if we look at the teacher , we 're 30 percent of the teachers , <unknown> <unknown> .
if we look at how the number of the <unknown> <unknown> has changed the largest decade of the united states has lost every year .
can it be that all the parents are doing wrong ?
that all children are <unknown> , and that the teachers were being exposed to the fact that they were being caught ?
or it 's the way that we have a <unknown> system that does n't seem to be just as a way that , but it 's not like that as the <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> years ago , which is just a very good thing .
and we found many people who looked like , and we 've found people who have no people that were n't going to have no kids .
and they understood that they need to take responsibility for the future they need to take responsibility for the future , to make our children and our children , to work with school , to work with the way .
and we 've got a lot of <unknown> in the new york , and there 's a whole bunch of great initiatives that want to change the school , and there are there are schools schools , and there 's very good <unknown> , and there are almost all the
and there is even a <unknown> , other , the eternal <unknown> principle , then you can actually go to the first step of the first step , and then we 've got to start the first step .
and how should we help help us as a <unknown> ?
we did n't have a concept that we could have been able to help about help in the time .
but we can make a thing , we can go in these schools , and we can actually find that schools , people who are school , so the parents and the students , together , and we can do with them all together in two days .
so there are people who live together in the past , and they 've been working on all the time for less and they learn how to talk about two days , which means it 's a way to work with each other .
so what happens to do with is a very unusual challenge of making a horrible challenge of which they have to solve together , and they have to solve all sorts of things that we 've got in common .
and after two days , they 've been working on a new <unknown> or a <unknown> for the <unknown> , for a new school , a new school , which is only to create a <unknown> school , and we can actually be able to do
or the thing that are a terrible deal of <unknown> for the problems that have been in their school , evolved , evolved in the schools , evolved in the schools ,
within two days , a new yorker developed a new way of <unknown> that would be possible at the next day when you might be able to go back to the next day .
but what 's the scariest thing is , what 's happened in the two days , and that 's what i 'm going to do is to do the very few pieces of hands i 've been saying , then in time , in school , the way that you 're going to do
if the three things are going to be the same things together , which is something like a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
so , in fact , <unknown> <unknown> thinking , and if you 've seen as a team of a company .
and this is the kind of a <unknown> , the <unknown> , the <unknown> , the <unknown> .
and if we then put four weeks to the <unknown> , and then we 've been talking to the fact that the school began to be a way to change , that we 've been totally new new culture in the
this is incredibly <unknown> .
and i 'm just to give you to speak to speak about school thinking , in the way .
i 'm asked to give them to speak to think about how to think about school , about living .
and i 'm <unknown> for them , and i 'm also about to talk about what to talk about about to speak .
talk about what you 're looking at , but you also think about what you do n't like to do .
they 're going to be surprised how much of you would get and how many people have the first ever experience , but just not talk about it .
let me bring them to each every single school in germany in the 20th century .
let 's change the whole education system .
and let 's do that in the way that we do with the people who live in school , with the parents , the parents and the students and the students .
because only , we can do it , we can do it .
thank you .
