when steve diana , adam <unknown> , one day , when we were going to go through the streets of the center of the center of los angeles , he was going to see a wonderful music .
she was from the man , a bottle , <unknown> , <unknown> , nurses , who did on a violin that had only been one of them with a violin that had only two strings .
many of you will know about the story , because of the article , written by a book , which was a <unknown> , and robert <unknown> as a <unknown> , and the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , who was the early detection , and the end of
<unknown> left was <unknown> , and a <unknown> and 30 years later , he was a <unknown> years later as a <unknown> <unknown> on the streets of <unknown> <unknown> at the center of los angeles , in the center of los angeles .
i 'm sorry to read all of the book , or to look at the film , not just to tell the wonderful narratives that are created between these two men , and also , as the instrument was to <unknown> the <unknown> , <unknown>
i met <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> in the 2008 , 2008 , two years ago , two years ago , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
he had just been a <unknown> of the first stage and <unknown> <unknown> , and came behind the stage to tell me , and i 'm going to show you the point to me .
he talked about a very <unknown> and <unknown> sound about digital dogs and hillary clinton , and how the dodgers would n't make the same world together . and the whole thing in the first disabled is the first <unknown> of the first
we came up to speak music . and a few days later i got a email , i was a email , who was <unknown> for the <unknown> to me .
i need to say that <unknown> <unknown> a voice that i think was a medical treatment , because he was already used to <unknown> and <unknown> and <unknown> , a <unknown> that had been put his entire life .
as a result , it 's particularly high in the <unknown> , and that 's sometimes bad , and he raced to a day , and then she went back to the streets of <unknown> , and then the <unknown> and his <unknown>
and in this case , a <unknown> was a <unknown> when we started with our first <unknown> in the norwegian <unknown> studio , he had this hypothetical <unknown> into his eyes and seemed completely lost .
he talked about invisible and <unknown> and how he would <unknown> to him , and he was asked to him him to <unknown> them in the couch .
i was scared , not <unknown> , but i was scared that i could go to him , he could go into a inside of his own , and i started to put his relationship with a <unknown> , and i started to <unknown> the <unknown> and other art shapes
so i started just to play a play .
i played the first sentence of <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
and as i started , i was playing , and i was going to have been that , in <unknown> , that in a very good way , a <unknown> change in the time .
it was like , when it was under the impact of a invisible leader , a chemical reaction , which is my own response to me , and i was a part of my game .
<unknown> <unknown> ar fled turned into understanding , and in a quiet curiosity , understanding in a quiet curiosity and <unknown> <unknown> .
and as a miracle took him a hat , and started to put some clips to play with <unknown> , and asked me to play her , to go to the end of the <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> .
we started to talk about music , starting to <unknown> from <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , and all the other <unknown> , from <unknown> <unknown> , to <unknown> <unknown> , and <unknown> <unknown> ,
and i realized that he was n't just a <unknown> knowledge about music , but he was able to deal with a very personal personal relationship with the time .
he talked about her passion and a understanding that i was only just in my colleagues in the <unknown> of los angeles .
by switching him , and talk about music , was that young man , who was just <unknown> by the streets of los angeles , a <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown>
music is medicine , music is <unknown> , memory changes us .
for <unknown> , music 's music means `` <unknown> '' health .
because the music allows him to tell him his <unknown> and grandparents and help with help his imagination and creativity in some real <unknown> experience .
and so he <unknown> his <unknown> traditions , and so he <unknown> his <unknown> traditions .
i understood that what this is the nature is the nature of art .
and that 's why it 's what we do music : so we 're doing something that 's in all of us , is inside our minds , our feelings , to our own form of reality .
and the reality of the magic of us all has changed the way that all started , and move to us , and explore , and we 're going to move ourselves to us .
what warhol <unknown> was doing , and so what was he told me to do music music , we took the music back to a computer of friends .
the <unknown> force of the music got it back into a family of musicians that he felt that he was writing the purpose of his life , and he was reading it .
and i 'm going to go back to <unknown> music , whether it 's in the disney disney hall park , or in 1968 , he realized , why i 've been a lot of math , and i realized why i 'm a musician .
thank you very much .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i 'd like to play something that i was going to do with the i just put on the <unknown> of a <unknown> , which is a <unknown> <unknown> .
i hope you apologize me to me .
so i 've had a lot of people in my life , and i 've found a lot of fish fish .
i just have loved love .
this first , this was more like a <unknown> <unknown> .
it was a beautiful fish , <unknown> , good , <unknown> , a <unknown> , a <unknown> on the <unknown> .
what a meme , which are a fish .
better , he was used to be <unknown> in <unknown> , and then they were <unknown> into the <unknown> of the highest two-percent development of sustainability .
so , you might feel feel to sell him to sell him .
i had a relationship with this beauty , a new relationship about several months ago .
one of the <unknown> party was a company called `` and i asked if i had a dream of the patient , i could have a dream of the local capital of the ground .
of course , of course , `` i said .
here was a company that was trying to solve the idea of what this extraordinary problem is to be our innate problem , how do we keep fish on our <unknown> ?
in the last 50 years , we have the first competition we 've got the oceans , and we 've been able to melt the oceans , and we 've realized , `` we have <unknown> forests . ''
it 's hard to find the destruction of <unknown> destruction .
ninety percent of the big fish , who we love , the <unknown> , the <unknown> , the <unknown> , the <unknown> , they 're <unknown> .
it 's almost nothing about a big deal about nothing .
so , or anything or bad <unknown> , <unknown> , a part of our future , is to be part of our future .
many of the content is that it 's <unknown> . how do you make sense of the environment , most of you are , but they are inefficient , we 've mapped it , and we 've got a burst .
he has a <unknown> of a 15 miles away on one .
that means that 15 is a total <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , which have you get a german <unknown> .
not very sustainable , not sustainable , not very low .
it 's not very good at all right .
so here 's finally a company that was finally a company that tried to make it right , and it 's really right to do it .
i wanted to persuade her folks .
and the day of the event , i made the boss before the <unknown> event , i called the boss of the <unknown> <unknown> for the company .
we call it the <unknown> .
`` let 's say , `` well , just to understand the facts right now , you 've been famous for the way that there were n't going to be in the outside that you 're not going to do the way you do n't make the environment . ''
`` the truth , '' he said . `` we 're so far that we 're moving away , the power of our <unknown> is made by our fish , not <unknown> . ''
and then he <unknown> , and he 's basically , `` we 're essentially a world 's worth of us .
this <unknown> of <unknown> <unknown> , he said , `` he said . '' he said . he said .
the best in the industry . ''
<unknown> , one of the great things , great , great .
`` <unknown> to one of what ? what is you doing ? what is you doing ? ''
`` technology proteins '' he said , `` he said . ''
`` great , '' i said . '' i said .
and i 've been at the night , and i was in bed , and i thought , `` what the hell is a <unknown> protein ?
so i called the next day , i just wanted to go back to the nearest day , at the event , let 's say , `` i 'm afraid of the event , '' and what i did .
i said , `` well , what is wrong , what is the way of the way , for example , what are the technologies like , are the sustainable way ? are so much resources ? ''
he said , he said , he said , he does n't know that . he 's not going to do it . he 's going to do it . he 's going to do a <unknown> .
well , i 'm <unknown> with a couple of people in the company . nobody had to give me an <unknown> answer . until i finally got to the mit to most biologists of the <unknown> .
let 's say , `` let 's say that again , we 'll say it 's a minute .
`` 'i said , `` i said , `` what are the use of these big use ? ''
now , he mentioned some algae and a few <unknown> , and then he said , `` he said , `` he said , `` he said , `` he said , `` he said , `` he said , `` he said , `` he said , `` he said , `` he said , `` he said , `` he said , `` he said , `` he said , `` he said , `` <unknown> ''
i said , `` <unknown> ? ''
he said , `` yes , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> and <unknown> , '' and what we 're doing is , '' and what we call the tools . ''
i said , `` how much of the number of the <unknown> is a chicken <unknown> chicken ? ''
in the assumption of example , maybe two percent .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent of the 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` well , what 's missing is , what is sustainable sustainable to chicken chicken ? ''
and a long time in the second and he was a long time , and he said , `` there are just a lot of chicken chicken , '' and there 's just too much chicken in the world . ''
i 'm going to <unknown> myself in this fish .
no , not , because i 'm a <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> .
and i even do .
no , i 've actually been able to put <unknown> in this fish , because i <unknown> <unknown> god , and the fish that he was looking at this point of chicken <unknown> .
this second fish , which is a different kind of material , which is another kind of <unknown> <unknown> .
it 's the romantic way , in terms of what you 're going to know is the very difficult way to have to have a fish , you 're going to love the fish , more love .
i 've got it to <unknown> him a <unknown> in a restaurant in <unknown> , and i had a <unknown> .
a <unknown> journalist had been talking about this long ago for this fish .
it has us <unknown> us from a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit
he came up with the table with a <unknown> , almost black light , almost <unknown> white color .
the chef had him <unknown> him .
take us back to each other .
he was still a bad guy . he 's still delicious .
who can make a fish feel good , while he was <unknown> with his <unknown> , was he <unknown> ?
i ca n't , but this guy , it 's a guy .
let me call it <unknown> , actually , actually , in fact , is called the bone marrow , he 's a mathematician .
and no , he did n't have a fish out and not be a guy . at least , no one . in the way they 're and i understand the same thing .
he 's a biologist at <unknown> <unknown> la <unknown> <unknown> .
this is a <unknown> <unknown> in the <unknown> woods .
it 's close to the <unknown> of the river of the river .
until the 1980s was the farm in the house of the hands of <unknown> , in the end of the <unknown> .
they were <unknown> , which we 've been called <unknown> , which is basically what 's <unknown> , which is basically the <unknown> , which is the <unknown> .
they made that by <unknown> the <unknown> .
they built these complicated webs of peanuts , and they <unknown> water from the country , and it also <unknown> the floor in the river .
well , they could n't do that they were n't going to be , that was the case , was that , in the way , the oakland , not so economically , but economically ,
and it was a disaster . it 's a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds around what they were doing , which is a lot of birds in the field of many different places .
so , there 's a <unknown> company <unknown> on the surface of the software , and the <unknown> movement bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have the top of the water on the water on the water on the water on the water .
they 've literally blocked the <unknown> <unknown> .
instead of the water , they used the russians to have the russians to <unknown> the slaves to <unknown> the water back to the water .
they <unknown> the radio islands .
they created a endangered acres of <unknown> -- <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , bears -- and they have fewer and his company , the <unknown> , the pollution of pollution ,
the farm is incredibly powerful .
i mean , you never saw anything that never happened to you .
they 're in fact , on the side of the country that 's a million miles away , and everything they see is that they 're looking at <unknown> <unknown> and those <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> .
i was n't there yet , there 's a long time ago , nor recently , after all of the time , nor was a long time ago .
it 's a tremendous guy , three parts charles darwin and a part of `` a nigerian tale , and a part of `` a <unknown> for the audience , '' as a <unknown> for the audience . ''
okay ? because we were coming and we took us through the <unknown> and i <unknown> and <unknown> , and then we go back to the <unknown> , and i <unknown> the <unknown> , and jay <unknown> a quiet .
and this is a <unknown> <unknown> probe that we took a rare <unknown> <unknown> .
now he <unknown> the <unknown> of <unknown> .
and here , here 's a pattern of <unknown> that makes me feel the <unknown> conceit .
it turns out that miguel has its biggest part of his career in the <unknown> park in the early academy in africa , and in the national park in africa .
i asked him how he got to be a <unknown> , and then she 's been able to be <unknown> such a <unknown> .
he said , `` fish ? i do n't have some fish in front of me , i know nothing about fish .
i 'm a joint app for the relationships . ''
and then he goes back into <unknown> , and it 's <unknown> into more enough of these birds of birds and algae and <unknown> <unknown> .
and you do n't understand me wrong , that was really amazing , you know , the <unknown> community of <unknown> , so in the way it is like in a way .
it 's great , but i was great , but i was in love with love .
and my head was weak in this <unknown> piece of paper , which i had on the <unknown> .
so i wore it out . i said , `` hey , bob , what 's the hell of the people who are so good for people ? ''
he showed up the algae .
`` i know , boy , boys , the algae , the <unknown> , the relationships , that 's unbelievable .
but what do your brain do their fish ?
how is the <unknown> ? ''
well , he goes to tell me that it 's a <unknown> system that the fish eat what they would be in the wild .
the biomass markets , the alberta , the stratosphere , the <unknown> , which is what the fish pump , and it 's what the fish is going to be .
the system is so healthy , it 's all healthy , it 's completely <unknown> .
there 's no food to buy a food .
one of the one belongs to one farm that your customers do n't not protect their oxygen ?
and i day back to this site , i was on the way of the room , and i asked him , `` i 'm a way to be so much , because of a farm that i was ever had , `` how do you succeed ? ''
and so what i did , though , if a <unknown> would have to be a <unknown> , and i had a <unknown> <unknown> , and if you had a <unknown> effect .
and we read the corner and we 've been <unknown> to the most beautiful picture , thousands and thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of years ago , a literally <unknown> carpet , so far ,
`` it 's success , '' he said .
`` look , your <unknown> , <unknown> , pink , <unknown> , '' because it 's pink , '' and so i 'm going to be <unknown> .
they <unknown> . ''
<unknown> ? i was completely confused .
i said , `` ironically , `` sometimes , do n't give me the fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we lose 20 percent of our fish and the <unknown> , and we 're <unknown> the birds , and the <unknown> of the birds are <unknown> .
now last year , i was in this place of 26 birds , and they were more of these birds of the birds of the birds , more than 250 million species .
it 's the largest and the largest one of the world , and one of the most important private private industry in the developed western <unknown> has been built in europe .
i said , `` sometimes , sometimes , is a good <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , who 's not the last thing that you want to have on a <unknown> ? ''
he <unknown> his head , no .
he said , `` we 're going to put <unknown> , we did n't build <unknown> , not enough .
this is a <unknown> network that is a <unknown> network .
the <unknown> <unknown> the <unknown> is the <unknown> .
the hippo food are eating the cyber protection .
so the <unknown> <unknown> is the weight of the weight better , the <unknown> . ''
okay , let 's imagine that a society where the food is not to protect their oxygen and a farm that 's their own <unknown> of their health care .
a <unknown> , but also a <unknown> , but also a <unknown> cell .
oh , and by the way , the way that the <unknown> of the <unknown> of the things were not even though the time is not even going to be there .
they 're attracted to the city of a mile miles away where the <unknown> works better than the <unknown> is <unknown> for the <unknown> .
every morning , they fly 60 miles per capita on the farm .
and the night of the flying fly , they fly miles miles away .
they do that , because they 're doing the fact that they can the <unknown> white line of the line of the <unknown> , the <unknown> line .
seriously .
i had a kind of time of a grant from the penguins of penguins , so i looked at a hurry .
i said , `` hey , sometimes , go to <unknown> miles miles miles , and then then you get it down by a half miles after night ?
do you do that for the children ? ''
he looked at me , and i looked at me , and i looked at a song of a <unknown> , and i was just a <unknown> , and i was just a <unknown> .
he said , `` no . '' they 're doing that . because they 're doing that because the food is better . ''
i did n't mention the skin of my loved fish that was delicious , and i like no <unknown> . i like n't <unknown> them . i like n't <unknown> them . i like n't <unknown> them .
it 's this <unknown> , <unknown> toes .
i 'm not going to leave you on the legacy of my own shoes .
and yet , when i try to go back to this restaurant in <unknown> , you do n't even have to go to the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
they liked <unknown> and <unknown> , as if you could take a bunch of two of the ocean .
i mentioned that was sometimes against the royal , and he <unknown> .
he said , `` the skin works like a <unknown> like a bicycle , which is a <unknown> .
it 's the last honor to get before the task is going to go into the body .
it has evolved to the evolution of evolution , evolved to <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> . ''
and then he <unknown> , `` he 's going to say , `` but our water has no electric <unknown> . ''
okay . so in fact , a farm that you did n't do is you , and she did n't have a fish ; she was a farm that 's moving her success , and she 's <unknown> her success at the success of her success .
and then i realized that if he says , a farm that has n't made a <unknown> , he <unknown> massive , because the water that goes through the water coming from the open
it 's a river that is all of the things that are being able to be , of the rivers of rivers , are already to come up , chemical pollutants , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> of <unknown> .
and when it comes to the system , and this is the water , and the branches is the water , as it 's like , it 's like <unknown> .
the system is so healthy , it 's so healthy , the air pump down , water <unknown> the water .
so , just just a farm that does n't feed your animals , not just a farm that 's your <unknown> , which is <unknown> , and it 's a farm that 's literally a <unknown> , and it 's
because if water water down , because <unknown> water <unknown> it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i 'll take it , and you can also do it , because these <unknown> , as well as a result , as a result , i 'm also <unknown> .
you might say , you might say a recipe for the best , if you 're going to talk about your own business , whether we 're talking about <unknown> or <unknown> , '' and <unknown> , and <unknown> <unknown> .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from a <unknown> in which we actually made music , and in the food we 're doing ,
but for many people , it 's a little bit of radical , and so many people are going to be a little bit of radical .
we 're not a <unknown> , we 're <unknown> , we 're <unknown> . we are skeptical . we are skeptical . we 're unintelligible .
we love <unknown> . we love small <unknown> . we talk to spend local food , we eat <unknown> food . we eat <unknown> food .
and if you 're saying that the things are the same time , the future of the landing is going to go somewhere else , and say , `` hey , i love <unknown> <unknown> , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? ''
can i be honest , right ?
i do n't want to say that question .
no , not , because we 've gone enough enough calories , to make more energy around the world , just more than more than we 're going to feed more than only more than more than we 're going to feed more .
a billion people will be <unknown> today .
a billion -- that 's more than ever since -- before <unknown> <unknown> in the distribution , not the <unknown> .
well , i do n't like that question , i do n't like , because it 's the logic of our <unknown> <unknown> , which is the last 50 years ago .
<unknown> grain on <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , to the earth , chicken in the way , and all the time has been <unknown> the <unknown> , and if we eat more people less ? how can it be
this was the <unknown> industry . it was the <unknown> . it was the logo . it was the logo . it was the <unknown> . it was the <unknown> of the agriculture .
we should call them what 's called a <unknown> in a <unknown> , a <unknown> that <unknown> fast <unknown> , which is that the production of it is to <unknown> the production .
this is not a piece of crime , and it 's not agriculture .
our <unknown> today is about the <unknown> today , not as <unknown> , '' because of <unknown> <unknown> , but because of the resources resources , they can produce more resources .
not by the latest <unknown> and <unknown> , but by a country , and it 's almost like a tree , and through a tree , and through rocks , there 's a terrible water , not by irritating , but through private and 150,000 , and through fish in the sea .
what want to feed the world ?
let us start with question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we make sustainability that all of the community can allow us to feed themselves ?
to do that , do n't look at the <unknown> , the <unknown> , the <unknown> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done . it 's done .
capital , chemistry and chemical machines are still in the <unknown> and so it has never been doing something very difficult to eat .
let 's take a look at the ecological model .
this is the one that 's the world 's largest <unknown> <unknown> of <unknown> <unknown> .
look at tivo , as muslims , for example , even as adults , '' even though , `` hello , '' xl .
firms , who are not worlds to make organizations , muslims who are the perpetrators of the <unknown> rather , <unknown> , the plants , whereas they 're also <unknown> , rather than any other , they 're not just <unknown> , who are not just
because they are the ones that are also experts who are <unknown> for the things .
and if i really do you 're right , you 're a better biologist , i 'm going to be a better richard , i 'll be the best .
you know , that 's me , because if it 's the future of food , it 's going to be right .
thank you .
if i want to ask you a really important thing , the idea of the data that we consume is , as a percentage of your own , and instead of thinking about it , we can also learn to understand information that we can use information , we can see how we can see that
so what we see here is a picture of a <unknown> <unknown> age .
the program i 'm doing is a model that is a little experiment , is a little experiment .
it 's called <unknown> , what i can do with <unknown> , that i can put them in a certain degree , i say , survive , whether it 's about the blogosphere , say ,
and i immediately experience a different pattern of view that 's going to be able to make a pattern that makes you .
and that because , because in the <unknown> , the people here are the most important place on the <unknown> , and they are over here over the <unknown> .
we can go and take a step further , and we see the data , and look at the data that we have , and the way that we see the <unknown> and cancer , and the <unknown> is not surprising , but not just to everybody .
so if we go further , and to age age , we 'll see 40 years , and we think we notice that obesity is the lack of the challenges that people should worry about people .
and the <unknown> is that that looks a fact that the same thing is most good at all of the time .
so what you see is that the look at the data from information and data , in the way , and data in this kind of information is actually spreading by working in a way in a living environment .
and if we can do this for the data , why not the same thing is , is the same way to make itself ?
what we 've got here is the <unknown> of every single <unknown> <unknown> , who have been found out of the <unknown> .
it 's all right here . it 's all over online here . it 's all <unknown> online .
it can like to think about it to my talk in your <unknown> .
with <unknown> , they can detect a <unknown> in a decade or a half a decade .
you can download some possible in a certain year .
you can click on a specific copy of a specific sign .
if i look at this , i see the <unknown> that <unknown> the way that look like this in the garden and the <unknown> <unknown> .
i 'm a document armstrong interface , so i 'm going to come to me all the time that i 'd been told me all of the document , which will be accepted by the algorithm .
now , if i want to get a <unknown> trip , i could think , `` okay , what if i 'm going to look for your thinking of <unknown> ? ''
so i 'm going to step back to step back and take the perspective and look at the point , and i 'm going to show you the <unknown> .
now , i think that <unknown> can <unknown> <unknown> .
and so you get a idea that you get on this kind of , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
you do something that 's actually a little different .
it 's something between you and we think we think it changes the way that people can be used to use , as information is possible .
i want to do this idea of a little bit more bit about a little bit more about something that 's a little crazy .
what we 've done here is we 've all taken every single <unknown> of the <unknown> , and it <unknown> <unknown> a little bit of a <unknown> --
the summary of the mantis shrimp contains a short <unknown> and a symbol for the area that comes from the area of which you are coming from .
i just just show the only 500 of the 500 of the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
but even in this kind of <unknown> , we can do a lot of things that we can do a lot of things .
and we 're going to give you a sense about the idea that are coming in the idea that are based on wikipedia , on the <unknown> , '' in the <unknown> .
i 'm going to choose the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
now , after i 've been <unknown> by the <unknown> , i know that the <unknown> , which is the most important place where the united states is about `` people 's year . ''
this is really important , because this is a realization that is a realization that not only a place that is not in a single <unknown> .
that 's just one of the time you notice , if you look at a step and you look at the whole thing , and it 's a result in the way .
<unknown> on a certain sense of the <unknown> , i can also go to the time in the <unknown> era of `` the <unknown> '' in the year , '' and all of us see there .
now , if i think all of those people , i know , the majority of these are the <unknown> . some of the science , some of them are , there 's less , less , you 're going to be a <unknown> , and the one of the <unknown> , and one of the <unknown>
and interestingly , a lady , there 's a writer of apple also also a ted prize winner .
so we can now look at this moment , and we can take a look at the moment of ted ted , and look at the ted prize winner .
you see , we look at the web , the first time as it is really really the web , not just the moon , not just from page , but much more diverse .
so , i want to see what what might happen to do is what else might show you what other might be like a little surprise .
i 'll just show you just a new york times square , which is a new york times , which is a new york times , which is a new old website .
<unknown> , this is what i call to not a browser , a word `` it 's not a browser , but you can look at the browser for the rest -- and we take these <unknown> to a <unknown> website like this one website like this
so , i can go back to step again , and i can go back to a certain <unknown> <unknown> , and i can go straight into a specific <unknown> <unknown> .
so this is important because it only just because of the look at the very different images of the people in this way , to make all the <unknown> in the same way of the way to make the same way of the same way of the same way of the way it could also look at the same way .
so i can actually come up in my process , in the process of <unknown> , i can go through a process of <unknown> .
here 's the state of the i 've been able to go to the whole little bit of this , and i 've been able to go back to this .
and i can also think of all of what i 've seen in the present , i 've seen all of the time in the time , and we can go back to the <unknown> , and i can also go back to the time .
and if i look at a step , and look at all of these , i could be able to find my view , i think , if i think that i 've seen my life on my <unknown> , here , i 've been looking for <unknown> , to be honest . ''
and from this point , i can go into the page and you can read it , and then she 's going to be able to go back to the back .
it 's a metaphor that will always be again again , and every time it 's going to be the size bigger than the sum of the <unknown> .
in the moment , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we talk about the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
we 're talking about the <unknown> in the wisdom .
what if we could do this situation , and the internet is to go to the head , so we 're going to go out from a way to the other , to start from a different way to start to have started to make things different from them ?
if we can do this , then the <unknown> will be , you can do something new <unknown> , maybe a new source of power information is something that you can learn .
and , rather rather than just light to information , we can get to get out of this .
and if we know that , we might think of that , maybe we can also be able to fix it , we can actually apply this information to this point .
so i hear the very few minutes , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unknown> <unknown> science of science fiction .
in my trial , i went to the bus , i went to school , and day , day day a day , a day of a day , a day of a birthday .
and my nose was in the book , a <unknown> <unknown> , which is my <unknown> of my thinking of new ideas and <unknown> in my emotional , and curiosity , <unknown> me , and creative curiosity .
and this curiosity also realized that i was not in school , to the east coast , and they took pictures , helicopters and despair and <unknown> and <unknown> , and <unknown> , all of them were left home and <unknown> , all of
i was totally totally <unknown> , you know .
it always was to make the attempt to understand the world and understand the limits of the kind of <unknown> ,
and my love to science fiction was <unknown> in my environment , because i was in the late '60s , and then on the late '60s , we went to the moon and we got the deep
jacques jacques came back into our living room with his fascinating show that we were able to see animals and places and a world of miracles that we could never asked to imagine .
now , this may also be very good at the <unknown> , and it 's all <unknown> to the <unknown> .
and i was artists .
i could draw draw . i could download paint .
and yet it 's not the video games for the <unknown> <unknown> with me to have the <unknown> of the movies , the whole <unknown> in the landscape , i had to create the pictures in my head .
and so we had to do this . when we were reading as a child , we were reading the book , we took the description of the <unknown> and <unknown> them on the screen and put them into the screen in our heads .
my response was to draw the draw and paint of alien , alien worlds , robot , <unknown> , all the way , and all the way , and all that way .
in the <unknown> , i was always fascinated by the teacher , i was , i was , i was , i was , i was , i was , i was , i was , i was , i was , i was , i was , i was , i was , i was , i was , i was , i was , i was , i was , i was , i was , i
the creativity had to be able to do it , they were able to be able to make it feel different .
and what happens is something interesting -- which was really fascinated with jacques <unknown> , was the idea of a whole natural world here in our earth .
i 'd never heard a virgin world with a space , and i was going to reach a spacecraft , and it seemed pretty unlikely to me , and i think that 's pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i was going to be built in the earth , and she was so fascinating and how almost like what i 'd been looking for , as i thought ,
so i decided to then when i was 15 , i was 15 , i was 15 to meditate , people were to be <unknown> .
the only problem with this was that i was in a little village in canada , a diameter of 600 kilometers from the next ocean ,
i do n't have to do that , i did n't get <unknown> .
i was so passionate about his <unknown> , and finally , a <unknown> in <unknown> , new york , shown that , made of the <unknown> side , which is where the united kingdom , where we lived .
i made my <unknown> <unknown> in a pool of <unknown> <unknown> at the winter of the middle of the winter in <unknown> , new york .
the ocean , a real ocean , i had only two years later , when we went to california , and we were <unknown> to california .
since then , in the 40 years , this is now <unknown> , i 've spent about three hours of water on 500 dollars , 500 hours of <unknown> in this year , in <unknown> ,
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the <unknown> ocean , where plants are living in <unknown> areas like being stuck with us , but we can actually have even able to imagine it .
the nature of nature knows nothing in the way that all the other to our own , <unknown> human imagination .
for decades , i 'm going to tell my characters that i think about the characters of what i see on what i see on my <unknown> view , which is the same way that i see on my <unknown> .
and my love to the first mate , and the oceans are <unknown> , and how do it was the same intensity as the world as the world , and the end of the time , and the end of the world , and the way .
when i was looking for a <unknown> , when a <unknown> was a <unknown> , it was the <unknown> <unknown> .
this was the best way to make my best , telling me the story , to share stories , to my own , images to create , to create pictures , to create pictures .
as a child , i was just <unknown> and <unknown> all the time and <unknown> it , and so on it .
so movies , the music of the time , the images of the front of the way , and the <unknown> of the <unknown> , and so <unknown> <unknown> , and that was so <unknown> .
of course , the stories i 'm going to do was <unknown> , the <unknown> , `` tom '' and `` <unknown> , '' `` `` <unknown> , '' and `` <unknown> . ''
and , `` <unknown> , i was having my own <unknown> for the <unknown> and the <unknown> with the <unknown> .
so , they were similar to me , both of them were connected to each other passions , which are <unknown> , and they were all elated .
something interesting happened in `` <unknown> '' : to create a <unknown> problem in this film -- and that we had to create a kind of liquid <unknown> -- we 've got to <unknown> animation , <unknown> , back .
what happened was , was the first brain-controlled <unknown> <unknown> that would ever look at a film in a movie .
the film was n't a money , and i was just a <unknown> , he just looked at the <unknown> , but i found something beautiful : the audience on the world was like <unknown> from the magic
according to infantry , henry 's law is law enforcement to be <unknown> technology and why do n't do n't even more about the other way to make more different from the other .
so they saw something that looks like a magic .
and i found incredibly fascinating about what was really exciting to me .
and i thought , `` wow , this must be really hard to get involved in the <unknown> , '' so that 's called `` <unknown> '' a lot . ''
so we went to `` <unknown> two , '' the next movie , '' a new way , still a lot of time .
together with <unknown> , we have a <unknown> of the guy from black metal , and the successful <unknown> out of the way that the effect was going on , like this kind of thing would like .
and it worked . we had a magic game . and we had a magic game , and the effect in the audience was the same thing . but we 've got the computer , we 're going to get a little more money to a little bit more money .
from these two experiences of being a little bit of a whole thing , a whole new world has been created , and a whole new world of creativity for creativity for <unknown> .
so i started a company , with my good friend <unknown> <unknown> who had the best <unknown> of the best <unknown> and <unknown> , and i was called `` <unknown> <unknown> . ''
the idea of this company was to <unknown> the phase of <unknown> with <unknown> <unknown> , etc. , to start and see how to start with <unknown> and <unknown> with digital <unknown> .
and so we did that , and then we did that , and we did this , and we 've been doing this , and we 've got to <unknown> the way of a while , and we 've been <unknown> a bit of a while , and we 've been able to do it as a while , and i 've been able to do it as well as it was a bit of a while .
but the middle of the 1990s , we realized that we were in the <unknown> and <unknown> -- what we actually built the company -- i slow up to the <unknown> -- so slowly .
i had this piece of `` a <unknown> , '' the <unknown> should be in the visual effects and <unknown> effects , which is the <unknown> , which is necessary for the <unknown> , and the <unknown> should be <unknown> . and the world should be <unknown> . and the world should be <unknown> . and the world should be <unknown> .
but the <unknown> <unknown> looks so wonderful . and the people in my company told me that my parents were n't even there yet not to be able to create that .
so i decided that , and so i did this , and i made this whole film called the big film that was going on the big ship , which is going to be a <unknown> .
the <unknown> i took this as a <unknown> and juliet on a ship , '' and it was a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , a passionate film .
but basically , i wanted to test the wrong ladder to the real <unknown> of the titanic .
and so that 's why i did this film .
that 's the truth . the architect did n't know that . the same knew that i did n't know .
i 've convinced them to me , and i said , `` i 'm going to zoom in the wall . we 're talking about the real limb .
we will be able to show it in the movie of the movie .
that 's <unknown> to it . it 's a good computational quality of marketing . ''
and i <unknown> them to create a expedition .
sounds crazy . but that 's what he goes back to that again is that your own imagination can create a reality .
and then we actually have six months later , and i went to <unknown> in a russian <unknown> , <unknown> hole , four kilometers underneath the surface of the circle of the circle of the circle of the circle of the north atlantic , and i 'm really afraid of the real buddha of a <unknown>
this was no movie , no <unknown> , no <unknown> , that was real .
so , really , it has me always been displaying my whole story .
and the point that was so powerful , and we had to have cameras and <unknown> and <unknown> and everything , and we can make possible behavior .
and i was looking at how much these <unknown> , a very <unknown> , a <unknown> <unknown> .
well , they were also <unknown> and <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
you get into these nose , you get into this dark , <unknown> environments , where there 's hope hope that we do n't think it 's going to go back to it .
and i thought , `` wow , '' that 's the case as i 'm like , i 'm a very little bit of a <unknown> .
this is really cool . ''
i was really interested in the process of obsessed , i was obsessed with the deep sea .
anyway , the part of the piece of music and science has been , it was everything . it was fiction , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that could n't be <unknown> by me , and i was n't able to give me a farmer .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that could be able to make a visual effect , but i could n't imagine what i would see outside of the <unknown> .
and at some of the following adolescence , i 've seen seen in <unknown> , and i 've been never seen before , but i could have never seen any of the time before the time , when we saw them , i was
so that 's what i did was really doing a really <unknown> , and i wanted to get more .
and so i then had a very fortunate decision to make a unusual decision .
after the success of the titanic , i said , `` okay , i want my <unknown> to me as a filmmaker , as a <unknown> , '' and i 'm going to be able to make a very <unknown> . ''
and then we started to start to <unknown> the `` <unknown> , '' and we were often <unknown> with <unknown> <unknown> .
we went back to the titanic of the titanic .
we took small robots that we built in the way that we had built a <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
our intent was <unknown> , and the way the brain of the ship , looking at the ship , which was never going to be done before .
nobody had ever seen the inside of the <unknown> . you had no one in the way that we had no tools for this . so we made a lot of technology .
and i 'm here , and in the extent , the sky of the titanic , and a <unknown> , and look at these kinds of things that you see this kind of <unknown> here , and i know that the first time there was a
and i 'm wearing with a little <unknown> <unknown> through the front of the ship , and the <unknown> of the ship 's <unknown> .
i just really just really , but i think it 's kind of a <unknown> , but my consciousness is actually coming from the <unknown> , and i think that consciousness is in the <unknown> .
it felt like i was physically physically in the <unknown> of the titanic , the <unknown> of the titanic , right ?
this was the most beautiful form of a <unknown> , which i 've ever seen . because before i was looking for a corner , i just got to see what 's happening in the <unknown> of the <unknown> , because i took a lot of
and so the computer was a very clear copy of the <unknown> of the <unknown> of the ship , the <unknown> of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience of discovery .
they made this sense of fact that they were able to use this <unknown> <unknown> , and so their own minds in the car can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to find the other form of existence .
it was really incredibly profound , so awful .
and perhaps a little bit of what it might happen to show all of the decades , if you have <unknown> to do something , or different ways of <unknown> , i can imagine
after this condition , we started to figure out what we saw in the bottom of the things that was going to learn to think , for example , the <unknown> , where we saw these incredibly abstract animals . these are sort of a <unknown> , but here ,
they live with <unknown> assistance .
it 's not in a way of a global system , and we like that , we do that .
and so you see animals that are directly directly to a different from a 500 of two kilograms of a <unknown> , you can survive , and you can survive , and you can survive .
and so , i 've been working on the same time for the very time for <unknown> , that was back to the <unknown> of my childhood .
and so i ended up to work with people who are interested in space and <unknown> the nasa , and <unknown> <unknown> . they go to the <unknown> , and the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> shares a
this was amazing .
but at the end , it turned out to be able to show you that i was <unknown> with the deep sea of the deep sea .
i took them with the atmosphere , and i <unknown> them up to the world , <unknown> , <unknown> , people who are working for such <unknown> , and i took them to the sources of how they could move around , and take away from the
we used to have been trained , and i was <unknown> , but actually , science , '' but exciting , science , more , more , <unknown> .
so the circle between my existence , as a <unknown> , as a child , as a child , and the way in the reality , and the <unknown> in the reality .
in the back of the experiments , i 've been a lot of learning a lot of learning a lot .
i 've learned a lot about science . but i 'm now thinking about , for example , i 'm sure you 're going to be able to be a second person , to be a leader , a leader like a <unknown> or a
but i understood , i 'm not thinking about a lot of leadership , because before i put this <unknown> , i <unknown> this <unknown> <unknown> .
because in my particular point , i had to say to me , `` what am i going to do ?
why do i do this ? what 's going to come out ? ''
these crazy movies are not going to do not us do a money , and we do n't have no money on it .
we 're just playing the <unknown> <unknown> . in the <unknown> of the <unknown> , no <unknown> .
all right , i think , `` i think , `` i 'm a nonprofit '' and `` titanic '' and `` <unknown> , '' and i was going to give you a few seconds to a <unknown> on the towel on the beaches .
i 've all all these slides , these <unknown> , who was a very <unknown> audience , made it for a very small audience .
no link , no honor , no money , what are you just to do ? what are you doing ?
you make it the task , and the ocean is the <unknown> environment that there are . the power of the <unknown> , because of the strange dictatorship , which is where you have a team of people .
because we 've all been all about this to be 10 to 12 people to 12 years , and years after we were two to a few months ago , and we were two to a few months to the city ,
and in this community community , you know that the most important thing is to be able to measure that you have to have a different place because you have a function that you can explain to you do n't know what 's going to explain
if you go to the world , and say , `` we had to do it , '' the <unknown> , the <unknown> , and the difficulty , the <unknown> <unknown> , if you do n't know , and you could n't do anything else with your <unknown>
and this is a connection , and it 's a connection , a separate self .
so when i went back to the nearest film `` <unknown> '' -- i tried to make the same <unknown> <unknown> , which is a patient , <unknown> and steal them at the respect .
and so that 's really created the dynamic really , and it has changed the dynamic dynamic .
so i was back with a little team of a <unknown> team in <unknown> , and we were able to give you some exceptions with a new technology that we did n't have before .
it 's amazing .
a huge challenge for the challenges .
we were a very family family of a four years ago , and we were a very family family .
and so , what happens was , i mean , this kind of thing , it was a way of making films , and so forth , we were completely remixable , completely remixable .
there were people who said that we had this really <unknown> <unknown> of this really <unknown> and <unknown> on the planet , and we 're going to go to the planet a historic space .
for me , it was more of a <unknown> to make my job , my job , the kind of activity that changed changed in the outcome .
so what can we do from all of this ?
what are we talking about ? how do we learn ?
i think that part of the first is true , curiosity , curiosity .
it 's the most powerful human property , which is the most human quality of the visual quality .
our imagination is a force that can actually be a force that can even make a reality .
and the sum of your team is more than a more than the world of the world .
to me , to me , to me , to me , to me , young brothers , who say , `` give me a villager , i can make something else . ''
and i say , `` i do n't say , `` do n't you just take a <unknown> self , no <unknown> .
there 's other people for you . you do n't know you , bet on itself . but you need risks to you . ''
nasa won the <unknown> : `` failure is not a alternative . ''
but in the art and the way , we have to have a alternative , and it 's a very difficult thing to do , because there 's a <unknown> problem .
no important thing that creates innovation is the innovation , which was the cause of the risk of the risk of risk of risk .
you have to have to be willing to take these risks to take risks to take these risks .
that 's the idea that i want to thank you to work with the way . is , of course , a lack , a lack , but is a alternative , fear is not .
today , i 'm talking about you about energy and energy , and the economy .
and it may seem something that because the most pessimistic thing that are the most important thing in the foundation is mostly about the paths that 's the ability of the equipment and every time to make things that we can make and create to create the world two billion billion lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important for those people , which is even more important than for another side of the planet .
<unknown> means that their <unknown> will not grow up in many years . it 's too much or less .
this leads to <unknown> . it 's going to lead to the uncertainty . it leads to the power of it . it leads to madrid .
so , now , that will be a universal property that 's being terribly strong for them .
and also , the most important thing for you is important to be important for it , it 's important to be very important .
the fact is that if you could only get out of one thing to take a point to the price , you 're going to be a more important way , if you 're in the most important , if you 're in the most important , you 're more likely to be at the most important .
now , the <unknown> <unknown> is the <unknown> thing about the time .
in fact , in fact , the creation of the <unknown> is based on <unknown> <unknown> on the ground .
the <unknown> and the industrial change in the industrial revolution and even in the 20th century , there was a <unknown> case in the <unknown> , and so we have these <unknown> , <unknown> , we can make modern materials , and so many things .
so we 're in a wonderful situation in which we have in the wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price , we 'll be the price of 50 , we put on a new square , we put on a new barrier and that the dog 's room combined us .
co2 warms the planet and the equation and the equation for co2 is actually quite clearly clear .
they <unknown> the <unknown> co2 co2 , which is to be <unknown> , and these <unknown> has got some very negative effects . effects are the very important effects . effects are the <unknown> that the natural changes that are the <unknown>
now , the crux of the world and the <unknown> and the <unknown> <unknown> and the <unknown> , and where they are all there , there are some informational <unknown> , but not very many .
and there 's certainly <unknown> about how bad these are going to be the best . but they 're going to be extremely bad !
i asked the <unknown> , once , once , once , once , once , once , once , i said , `` have to really go down to zero zero to zero zero ?
does n't even spend half of a or a quarter of a quarter of a quarter ? a mile ? ''
the answer is : until we get close to zero zero , it will be moving zero , the temperature 's going to be further down here .
so it 's so a great challenge .
it 's something different than saying , we have a <unknown> truck at the top of the three hundred , and you can also put it under a full square bridge . now , you can also be able to come from here in the top .
this must be one to the bottom , zero to zero .
now , we put a lot of <unknown> , a lot of <unknown> , about two billion tons of gray .
every americans are about 20 billion people , and from the country of poor countries , less than poor countries , less than one .
in the average , it 's about five percent of every one of the planet on the planet .
and we need to make change changes that we need to reduce the land that 's going to lower the muscle up .
it 's also too late to be used to the bottom of the speed of the speed of the speed of the speed .
only different economic changes , it has been influenced by , and we have to have to get out of the rise of <unknown> over the oceans , and to reduce a barrel to zero .
this equation has four categories . a little <unknown> . they have this thing on the side of the water , co2 -- that will be dependent on the number of people , the source of people who are going to be the <unknown> , and the co2 energy will be <unknown> to the
so let 's look at each one of us , and let 's look at how we 're going to get rid of the way we get down to zero , and we 're going to get it down to zero .
probably one probably has to have to have a close to the numbers of a very much lower zero zero zero to zero .
now this is basic brute <unknown> , but let 's go through it .
we first have the first one thing . we have the population .
today , two hundred billion billion people are living in the world , and there are people two countries .
and it 's going to start to nine billion things that are going to move out to nine billion .
if we 're very successful with new <unknown> , the <unknown> and <unknown> , we can probably be 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the moment we see a <unknown> battery about 1.3 percent .
the second factor is the tool that we use , as we use , is that we use use .
that 's all the food that we eat , clothing , clothing , television , <unknown> , <unknown> spaces .
that 's very good things and <unknown> materials to make these materials that are saving for every access to every planet .
it 's great that this number is the size of the bottom line .
in the rich world , in the top , we could probably be able to make <unknown> and less efficient , but in average , there are fewer calories to double the year , and so far as a thousand , the amount of services to be built by a person
here we see a very fundamental service that there 's a very basic relevance . there are at light light to you that you can read the homework ?
and these students do n't have it , they go out and they go out and read about their <unknown> under the <unknown> , and i read the <unknown> under the <unknown> .
well , efficiency is efficiency , the siza , the energy per bottle , there 's already good news news .
we have something that does n't have something that 's not going to go down .
because of a lack of <unknown> in the <unknown> , through other <unknown> , through new methods , with new methods , there are many <unknown> , the small group of individual <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> to 90 percent .
in other , like the <unknown> of the <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> -- <unknown> <unknown> , or <unknown> <unknown> , or <unknown> <unknown> , is the <unknown> of the <unknown> for the very much more expensive .
so , in addition , if we 're optimistic , we might be a fatal to give a factor of two or maybe even a factor of six or maybe even a factor of six .
but in the first three factors , we 're now now about oxford , we 're now about 17 billion miles away from <unknown> <unknown> , and that only just did n't .
so we can see the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a <unknown> , and that 's the amount of co2 , which is going to be a <unknown> of the <unknown> .
it 's the question that if you can get that into zero to the bottom .
if it 's coal , by zero , no , no one .
if you get natural gas , you know , <unknown> . no .
almost every <unknown> of the electricity is co2 co2 , except for renewables , and more productive and <unknown> energy systems , and <unknown> <unknown> .
so , what we need to do is to do on the global level of a new system is to create a new system .
we need <unknown> .
now , if i use the term `` wonders '' -- i do n't recommend the impossible .
the <unknown> is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and the violence and the transportation is a miracle .
people have been talking about the development of many of these miracles .
usually , there are no <unknown> that you need a miracle to get a miracle to a certain date .
you usually usually see , you know , you 're just looking at the first time , and you 're all going to come back and you have some of them to do not others , not even other than not others .
in this case , we have to have a <unknown> , and we have to be a miracle to a <unknown> , very quickly , very long time .
well , i wondered , how can i really do this <unknown> ?
is there a natural <unknown> , a kind of <unknown> , a demonstration that 's the idea of people coming out here ?
i remembered my last year when i was diagnosed with <unknown> , and i was recruiting , and somehow i liked people liked it , people somehow .
the idea was really true to you , you know that there are people who are living with people living in rural countries .
energy is that , i 'm going to have a piece of energy that makes me on the right .
i decided that the <unknown> <unknown> of fireflies have my <unknown> <unknown> to the environment that would be here in the environment .
so here 's a few natural fertilizers , and they 're a bunch of natural natural fertilizers .
you told you that you 're not going to be sure you 're not going . but you do n't think you 'll just leave the glass .
well , there are all sorts of things like <unknown> , like this , but they do n't all have a lot of them .
we need solutions , either one of the things that have a unique properties and lack of <unknown> , and even though there are a unique way of different areas where people are looking for , i think only only one , which i can only do
i 've quote <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> and pepsi , and <unknown> nets .
and you could afford this a <unknown> , and if you could pay better than i 'd be , i mean , but i 'm a love to see , and i 'm not going to have to get out of all of our five , and we ca n't give them a
so let 's see , if we look at reducing reduce fossil fuels , by <unknown> , gas or smaller gas and natural gas , natural gas .
what you need to do is , maybe , you might be easy , but it 's not like , you know , you know , you know , you get all the co2 , which is to <unknown> up the <unknown> , the <unknown> comes from <unknown> , and then you 're all there .
there are some <unknown> that 's going to be 80 percent -- 80 percent of the things are going to be very difficult , and a way of a <unknown> challenge for the world 's atmosphere , and the most important problem is the <unknown>
who will it be doing it ?
who can you say something that 's going to be a lot of billions of times more than a different from the way you can actually do with <unknown> , and other other things ?
this is a lot of a chip . a huge ball .
so this is a hard <unknown> <unknown> .
next , next : <unknown> .
and so , the amount of problems . the cost , in the world , is in <unknown> countries , too , you know , you know , you know , you can really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human <unknown> , that the food is not going to be used to weapons .
and what do you do with the power ?
because even though it 's not very big , there 's a lot of view .
so three very difficult problems that might be organic , and you 've been working on with the way that you should actually work .
the last three of the five is i interviewed in the five three .
it 's the renewables as much as much as often as many often often get into the number of times , and they 're going to be called the <unknown> .
and also , if you have a -- you have a great thing that you need to have a fuel , you need no fuel -- you have some <unknown> , you have some <unknown> .
one is the <unknown> that we can use that the <unknown> that are these cooperative changes dramatically dramatically as much as much as the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
these are <unknown> , you talk about a lot of <unknown> , a more than a half of a <unknown> , a more than the normal food system , or more than a normal food system .
and then we 've also found that these <unknown> work on the sources of data that we 're using <unknown> .
the sun does n't seem to the whole thing , it seems sometimes not every day , and it does n't seem to be any day , and the <unknown> did n't move the way that always was always changing the time .
and so you have to think that you 're dependent on these sources , and then , if you have a way , the way , the energy , even more than you will not be available to get in .
so there 's big <unknown> . there 's challenges that we 're going to do , and we say that the power of the country is , you do n't just use the technology , you do n't have to deal with the risk of the
and there 's a <unknown> problem .
and to show the process , i 've been able to look at the species of how the cars , computers , computers , everything that 's the world of the world , using that , and what i found is that all the bacteria we can do is less than 10 minutes of the
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that that 's going to be a better than 100 , and the sensor will be better than the time is going on .
it 's not impossible , but it 's not so easy .
this is what happens when you try to make these <unknown> waves of a little bit like we 're going to call 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest of the rest of the rest .
if you want to reduce 100 percent of this , you need a incredible <unknown> machine .
now , where we 're going to do , what 's the right approach ?
a <unknown> project , what about the project ? how do we go to the goal ?
what we need to do is a lot of companies that are working with hundreds of thousands of companies , hundreds of thousands .
in every single one of these five ways , we need to take at least 100 people in the same basis of our own .
and they 're going to say , they 're saying , they 're crazy ! so this is good .
i think there 's in the ted group group , there are many many of the ted group that you 've been able to get out of the <unknown> .
bill 's huge number , many other one of one , which has given the other <unknown> <unknown> , which has been the great <unknown> of the great <unknown> .
<unknown> <unknown> invest in dozens of thousands of jobs and <unknown> companies and make things that are interesting things and interesting opportunities , and i 'm trying to support this , and i 'm trying to support this .
nathan <unknown> and i 'm an artist who was able to create a company that might be able to say , but surprisingly to have a little bit of the things that <unknown> <unknown> , the <unknown> approach .
there 's some kind of innovations in the <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> .
the development has been stopped in this industry , so it 's not a great surprise that it was good enough that some good concepts back .
the <unknown> means that you 're instead of instead of a part of the <unknown> , the one percent , the <unknown> , we decided to <unknown> the 99 percent of the <unknown> , the <unknown> .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you 've been thinking about it , but you could never get a <unknown> , whether it would work , but since we 've got a lot of fuss , you can see it , and see that , yes , i said , `` you know , `` yes , ''
and because you have this important percent , it 's very much better than the best , and the <unknown> is very much better .
in fact , you get the garbage and you can actually put in the garbage of the nanoscale , and you can actually use the industry of today , and <unknown> can use the <unknown> .
instead of focusing on the head , you burn it , it 's just it . a great thing .
so uranium is <unknown> <unknown> , and it 's a <unknown> mechanism , a little bit like a <unknown> like a <unknown> .
you see that there 's a kind of a <unknown> , often as a <unknown> wave of <unknown> , '' because `` <unknown> wave can <unknown> . ''
this really really really really <unknown> the <unknown> .
here 's a picture of a place in a place in kentucky .
this is the consumer , the 99 percent . you have the part that you 're getting down to the today , which is going to be today , so you can <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
the <unknown> <unknown> the u.s. foundation for hundreds of years ago .
and if you 're <unknown> <unknown> and <unknown> , you 're <unknown> , you get enough control of the rest of the planet .
you know , there 's a lot of challenges , but it 's a number of thousands of concepts from concepts that we need to get to go forward .
let 's think about how we should measure measure of success .
how should our voices look like this , what would look like this ?
now , let 's go to the goal that we need to do and then we talk about the talk of the <unknown> .
a lot of difficulty about 10 percent reduction in 2050 , by 2050 .
it 's really very important that we 're going to get there .
the rest of 20 percent are going to be produced in poor countries , and still a space of failure , hopefully , will be <unknown> and <unknown> to the bottom of the <unknown> and <unknown> to the sunlight .
so , to get up the 80 percent of the time , the world , the countries , china , as china , as their matter , as china , their <unknown> completely different from the <unknown> .
the other note is that if we use the technology technology , whether it 's been used to be in the developed world , and we 're on the way to get them to the rest of them .
that 's really important important .
this is going to be a global picture of this system .
if we go back to the way we go back to the way we could look like the nuclear nuclear weapon was looking like ?
it should have been <unknown> the two elements together .
we should use the <unknown> to help reduce the way to the end of the things . the less we 'll be , the <unknown> is the <unknown> , and the temperature 's <unknown> temperature and so that the temperature can be able to take the temperature
but actually , this is a very part of the things that we do with the <unknown> , not to get to the big <unknown> , just just like , or even more important than the other , which is the <unknown> of innovation .
we 're going to be the institutions that we have to draw with <unknown> , and we can measure the <unknown> : the <unknown> , in <unknown> , in <unknown> and <unknown> .
there are many great books to this theme .
the al gore wrote `` we have the choice , and david <unknown> <unknown> , `` <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> the green air . ''
they really do it really , and you create a framework where the <unknown> can be discussed created because we need to support support from all sides .
there are some people who are going to come together to come together .
this is an wish .
and a very simple desire to say that we 're trying to make this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a <unknown> , and i love , or i could choose this desire , <unknown> <unknown> instead of <unknown> .
this has changed the biggest impact .
if we do n't have this wish , the retina will be <unknown> and cool people are getting sick , and the country and rich countries , and poor countries , and very ,
so what do we need to do ? what do we need to do ?
what are i doing for the things i do ? i do n't know ?
we have to use them to make more <unknown> for more <unknown> .
if countries come to places like <unknown> like a <unknown> , they should n't talk about co2 emissions .
you should talk to this <unknown> , and you would be <unknown> out of the simple <unknown> of the <unknown> , which is going to be <unknown> for these shared images that you will be brought together for these shared images .
we need <unknown> , carbon nanotubes , <unknown> control , continually <unknown> memory , which is a <unknown> <unknown> .
we have to move the spread out of this .
we have to have to make a lot of <unknown> and images and also the things that they 're going to be used to be the most of the government .
it 's a critical wish , but i think we can actually put it in the same way , and i think we can teach it in the way .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you . thank you !
thank you very much . just about something different from a way to look at it -- so , how can you give us a idea of the value of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation of a supercomputer to get all the great scientists , we need to have a few million . and even if we have our materials in the russian process , we have
the hard step is to build the first of the first <unknown> , to have another billion , where billions of <unknown> , the <unknown> and the place of which they have to do the first of them , and the areas of them have the first of them .
once the first thing is , when he 's going to come back like this , and then it 's all the things that it 's the way that the system that 's <unknown> , as we have
to understand the right thing : what 's called deep into the ground , like the vertical ball is going to be a <unknown> band , and then the beginning of the <unknown> and then forth ,
bg : right . today , you have to go through the reactor , and there are many people who are going to go wrong . so that you can go wrong . this thing that you go to and <unknown> , or <unknown> .
but if you have a cheap cell phone , you can put it for 60 years , think about a <unknown> -- which is <unknown> , you put it all the <unknown> .
and it 's sitting now and <unknown> <unknown> years long and then it 's done .
a <unknown> that 's a <unknown> that 's a solution for the garbage , and then you can get a solution to the garbage phases .
bg : yes . now , what happens to the garbage -- you can sit there -- there 's a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it into the next of , and then
and we start to use the waste that 's already made that in the <unknown> , and in the <unknown> , or the <unknown> is the <unknown> , and this is our <unknown> .
so , what we 've been doing is that problem with this instability is that what we 're going to do in our fill and that will be dramatically dramatically as much as a dramatic change during this process .
but while they were talking about different people in the world , we 've talked about these kinds of technologies that are already on these possibilities .
where is the biggest interest , which is really hard to do ?
bg : now we have n't been able to go to a place , and we have a lot of interesting <unknown> for all of the `` salvation '' in the problem , and there are great interest in the people , and where i was here and i 've been
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have a little bit of a little bit of the things .
this is a version of one thing that was made by a thing to do .
that 's a important step , but it 's as a faster map , and some countries have this built , so that 's why that is a very <unknown> bowl of a <unknown> , a <unknown> for the first
in your idea : the <unknown> and <unknown> and if it 's a really <unknown> to <unknown> really true to life ?
bg : now we need a single person , and the reason that things are very strong , that are highly expensive , we have 20 years to the r & amp ; and then 20 years , and then 20 years ,
this is kind of a <unknown> that we 've been doing the <unknown> that we 've got to have the <unknown> substance that we need to use diagnostics .
and , you know , you know , <unknown> , if everything is good , '' and that 's a great wish , it could be easy , it could easily be easy .
and luckily , there are dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of thousands of people , but when the common work work to work for their traditional work , that can be <unknown> .
and it would be the best if there 's several dimensions , because it could be a lot of the things , because then you could use a mixture of it .
in every case , we need a solution to the possibility .
what 's the big deal of uncertainty is is that the biggest ones you know ?
bg : a <unknown> is the <unknown> <unknown> is the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
it would have been done without the <unknown> , but it would have been a lot of <unknown> , but it makes so much more important than it .
in the nuclear sector , there are other kinds of companies that are other abstract firms .
you know , we do n't know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
there 's a <unknown> <unknown> , which is something that seems difficult to think , difficult , but maybe you 're going to tell you that , you know , that 's what we 're talking about .
and so there 's different , but the nice thing is that a <unknown> <unknown> has a million times like a lot of energy as we can do with the problems and the cost , the potential , the potential , the potential , the potential , the potential to <unknown> the
if that does n't work what if you do n't work what ?
do we have to get to <unknown> <unknown> , to try to understand what the math grid can do , to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to
bg : if you come to this situation , it 's as if you 've got to be too much more , and a moment of heart attack is , you know , you might need a <unknown> or something .
there 's a <unknown> that 's called <unknown> , which is linked to different techniques to make the warming , so that we 've been sending 20 or 30 years to spend us
this is just a <unknown> device .
and we hope that we do n't need to do this .
some people say , you should n't have to go to the insurance because you may be able to make a bad thing , so you 're going to eat because of that , you know that people will save the <unknown> .
i do n't know if the reason is smart , if you get the importance of this problem , but there 's a vending machine in <unknown> , if you 've got to have it , if you can have it , it 's going to be able to get it , or what these innovation is longer than we
<unknown> : have you have a bunch of sentences for two sentences for you to be able to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the story is the time of the ted in the <unknown> of the <unknown> of the <unknown> , and i think that 's a lot of different ways of <unknown> , and i 'm hoping for the <unknown> of a lot of <unknown> <unknown> .
the ones that are the science of the science , are very good for this , but very little , very little , very little , very little .
do you think that there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds , which are things going to get out ?
there are very , very few things you can say at least many people ca n't even have a chance of a million in every million .
the <unknown> here is something like you , like , the <unknown> here is like you , and what 's the most populous here is about aids .
you 're doing the mistake , and you 're going to make you a lot of time later , and you 'll argue that you 're very much later on it .
and so the idea is , if you have all kinds of <unknown> problems , to be able to -- what 's the nonprofit society does n't necessarily have to be clear , and that 's the most of the <unknown> report at the world , and you 're in the same world
the fact is that these goals is about to us that , and should n't get rid of us about this .
but my dream here is , if you can do it as well as the same co2 , and say , `` okay , i 'm not going to tell you that it 's not , because i 'm sure that it 's
and that would be the answer to the <unknown> <unknown> that if you use all the time , the world 's energy , all the other goals are in the diaspora , to create the <unknown> , to create a healthy waste of resources , to invest more than the
bg : well , the real estate for the research -- i want to make the u.s. national care , if we should spend five billion a year , you can do today -- that 's not sustainable dramatic .
because of course , they do n't have suffering suffering from the other things .
you get to <unknown> <unknown> , and here 's a poor people , if you have something that 's not political , and try to help it , and i 'm going to be able to create the most
it 's because you 're very short before , and it only has the <unknown> , and i think we should be thinking about things that are the potential to be very much less than that .
if the <unknown> you 're going to get , a very high <unknown> <unknown> , you can only take the rich , and then it can keep you the same way to keep it there .
i mean , everybody was going to spend five times more than any better way to do his change without his lifestyle .
for the lower two billion , but there 's a disaster .
and even more important ways to think about it .
his new <unknown> is a little bit of a little bit of a new question : `` why not if you do n't really have to talk about what the science of the science is n't talking about ? ''
it 's still because of his former stories , which is what we 're doing , but he understood that this is a very <unknown> group , and so he 's going to go back to the <unknown> .
and this is a <unknown> that i 'm going to do is a <unknown> that i think is to make sense of force .
the research , it 's just crazy crazy to how little <unknown> will be .
bill , i believe in my life , almost all of people , i say , i really hope that you 're going to be interesting , and thank you , thank you , thank you .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter <unknown> <unknown> a <unknown> called `` the <unknown> <unknown> '' a `` <unknown> '' '' `` the <unknown> '' was `` <unknown> '' ''
the idea is quite simple . the need to take the largest <unknown> structure of 20 <unknown> , and <unknown> <unknown> , and <unknown> <unknown> , ca n't build a marshmallow and a <unknown> .
the statue has to be the same thing .
and even though it 's really easy to be , it 's really really hard to do , because it 's going to work with it all together quickly .
and so i thought that this was a interesting idea that was a interesting idea , and i 've been <unknown> it into a <unknown> , and i made it into a <unknown> .
it was a huge success .
since then , i 've been about 70 circles in the world , with students , <unknown> and architects , even with the <unknown> of the <unknown> , and there 's a very interesting story to work in nature , and i want to share some of them
usually , most people people are able to do the way to force the way to orient to the task .
they 're talking about how they 're thinking about how it 's going to look , they 're going to be <unknown> , they 're <unknown> to power .
then they invest a little time in <unknown> and organization , and they 've made it and they 're <unknown> and they <unknown> them out .
they invest a lot of their time in the <unknown> era of the world increasingly <unknown> pollution .
and finally , before you do n't have time anymore , someone is the day , and they 're going to get it into the top , and step back and forth , `` <unknown> ! '' they make their work .
but what it is , it always felt like , the <unknown> is to be a <unknown> , because the weight of the <unknown> is that the whole thing that the <unknown> thing was and <unknown> .
there are a series of people who are much more <unknown> , `` <unknown> '' <unknown> people than others , and in the rest of the kids are fresh <unknown> .
they lie , they 're killing , they 're confused , they 're really <unknown> and they really are really <unknown> , and they really are really <unknown> shapes .
and of course , there are some more sophisticated <unknown> <unknown> , and in the best ones , and they 're young <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> .
and this is pretty amazing .
as peter , i did n't make them not peter , the only staff towers , but the most effective traits of all , but the most effective traits of all .
what may be like is , what is this going to ? why is what ? why what is the people who we do ?
and , peter , `` dan tells , `` no child , children 's children spend a lot of time in the <unknown> , '' and `` <unknown> '' the <unknown> of the <unknown> . ''
they do n't invest time in <unknown> .
but there 's another reason that even though , another reason .
and that means that <unknown> had been trained to find a real plan , right ?
and then it turns out to do it again .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you have n't got time to go and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , sound what it is , what ?
what 's different is , is that they 're going to do with the marshmallow and prototypes , they have a little bit of prototypes , and we 've been able to go back to the marshmallow , the <unknown> , that it also has a chance to repair a certain <unknown>
<unknown> indicate this kind of collaboration that are using the kind of relationships of a <unknown> <unknown> .
and with each trial , if you 're working on the way , the kids of feedback can be <unknown> , and what 's the way that work works , and what does n't matter .
so , the performance of the things that work is working with some time , is something -- but in fact , we 'll see how different teams have to start to do .
the average thing that are about , most of the most dangerous , <unknown> <unknown> are half of the lawyers , have something more , but not much , they 're better than the adults .
who 's the most successful ?
architects and engineers , engineers , luckily , happiness , happiness .
<unknown> is the fact that i 've been able to see , i was the first one of the earlier .
and why ? because they can understand and <unknown> <unknown> patterns are building the key to create the structures to create the structures to create a structures to create the structures to create a structure .
<unknown> is something about 100 . but there 's a lot of scale , but here 's how it 's interesting to happen . but there 's been interesting .
if you put a <unknown> <unknown> on the team , they 're getting better better than better than they 're getting better better .
it 's incredible . you see the `` this one 's going to be , and you know , this team will be put you . ''
you can predict that . so why ? what 's the thing about this ?
because they have a specific skills of the <unknown> skills that have been <unknown> .
they 're the beginning to get their process , they understand him .
and this team that makes you go and <unknown> and work in the work , the power of the progress is going to improve the performance of the teams of the risks of the risks of progress , and so forth .
<unknown> skills and <unknown> and <unknown> and whose rules lead to success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical thing , you have about four , you have about four times the six structures .
i tried to design something a bit of design .
i thought , i would take the <unknown> in front of the <unknown> .
so , i was a <unknown> to a $ 100 prize to software for software for the winners who brook a winner .
what do you think about these are the <unknown> ?
what was the result ?
this happened . so , this happened . so , this was what a happened . one woman had no surgery to make a stable structure .
if somebody could have a high high school experiment , it would have been a <unknown> on the ground , he would have been used the price of home .
so , what does n't mean , that high <unknown> has a strong effect of a big effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the computer that we use this computer program .
what 's now what is now what happens , what 's now if you think now , what 's now thinking of it ?
now they understood the advantage of the `` <unknown> '' but the <unknown> , '' which means `` <unknown> '' .
so , from the same thing , the first thing was a little bit of a <unknown> , one of the best ones .
they 've been the first of the <unknown> in the <unknown> era .
so , there are so wireless lessons for us to think about nature , and success of the nature of manufacturing and success .
so , what you ask questions : why would someone actually spend time spend a lot of making a <unknown> to build a <unknown> ?
the reason is , i 'm building digital tools and make it to create teams , to help teams to help cars , video games and video games and how to do <unknown> <unknown> .
and what 's the most firemen is doing is to make a hidden glimpse of creating some unexpected assumptions .
because the irony is , say , the project has been , your project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a shared experience , a shared language , a shared language of power , and create a way to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience that this is a simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in , and you can go to see <unknown> <unknown> .
it 's a blog where you see how you see the <unknown> .
there 's a <unknown> there there .
they find crazy examples of all sorts of different things from all the world where people like this system and <unknown> <unknown> , and <unknown> <unknown> .
there 's also <unknown> <unknown> .
and the most recent lesson , i think , is actually a <unknown> sports .
it means that we 're going to do all of our senses , and we 're going to use our way to use the way we think , the way we feel like , the challenge that we 're doing ,
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything that takes it to help us `` <unknown> , '' to a `` <unknown> '' moment to a `` <unknown> '' moment to a `` <unknown> . ''
and that can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
so , if we have this machine , i 'd like to make a machine that 's a little bit of a button .
a big machine , a cool , <unknown> machine , and that 's a little bit of a time .
and everyone in this room has to be in this room , in the room must be in the room .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you ca n't afford to go to the right corner , and you can stay in here , and now stay .
and i ask what they would choose because i had my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go all over the past .
i do n't know . they wanted to go back to the time before it had cars or twitter or `` america '' the u.s. . ''
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that the kind of thing that is kind of a <unknown> , is to interpret , that 's a strange statement , and for example , is that you can be simplified , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
and i understand that .
i 'm not part of this group , i have to say , `` i have to say , `` i 'm going to say , `` i 'm going to say .
i do n't want to be in the past , and i do n't , because i 'm a <unknown> , i 'm a <unknown> .
it 's because in the way , the possibilities of this on the planet will not come back , they go back to the direction of the way , go to the direction .
so , i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future , and i want to go to the future .
this is the most interesting time that had ever been on this planet , whether it 's a result of which , you know , are , wealth , <unknown> , mobility , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> .
there was never a time ago that was this time , and it was never the time that was so much of those things .
my <unknown> died of all of her dying , as they were growing 60 than 60 years .
my grandparents , these <unknown> neil this number of 70 .
my parents are <unknown> 80 of the <unknown> in the <unknown> .
so , if we want to talk about nine percent of the start of the beginning of my <unknown> ,
but it 's not just people like us , because this is a larger thing than that .
a kid who is born in new ways today , which can be a little bit of new ways to live as long as the richest man 's new york city around the world , 100 years ago .
think about it . and that 's what it 's about this . it 's an incredible fact .
and why is this ?
smallpox , smallpox smallpox has been billions of people on this planet since the year .
they 've created the demographics of the earth , a kind of <unknown> , as it did n't have war war .
they 're gone . they 're gone . they 're gone . they 're gone .
we 've got them <unknown> . tom <unknown> .
in the rich world today , the diseases of us have been a million of us only have a single year , not yet , but still , too few .
<unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> ...
anybody know somebody who would say what 's this ?
we can change our models , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , to become the successes of scientific technology , and that 's the reason why we have to learn .
and from my view , the scientific method to try to look at you , look at it , it 's going to change , it does n't work , if it 's not that , the most important part of humanity .
so that 's the good news .
unfortunately , it 's all the great news , because there 's been some other problems , and they 've been talked about , and they 've been talked about .
and one of them is that , despite all of our efforts , to have a billion people in the world to stay alive to bed every day , until they 're going to go to the day to the day to be long time to the day .
this number is rising , and it 's going to get very quickly , and that 's a very strange thing , and this is <unknown> .
and not only that , we 've got our imagination to be able to move this world <unknown> to the world of world ,
drinking water , <unknown> country , oil , oil , gas : gas , and it 's soon going to be soon , and if we do n't get out of this chaos , we can go
so the question is : can we can do that ? can we do this ? i think you 've got to do .
i think it 's clear that we can use food that 's going to feed the billions of people , and if we live in life , they went to ,
i think we can use that world with the way that you can make this world with energy that you could n't see , but it also shows that the same time you could n't see .
i really do that , and no , it 's no , no , it 's not a responsibility .
but this is what keeps me waking up at night -- one of the things that i do n't wake up on the night , and we 've got science progress , but never enough how much , not yet , i never have
and we were still never able to have him to make him <unknown> , like the <unknown> can be able to do it .
we 're at the end of incredible , amazing events on many places . and yet , i really think that we have to go hundreds of thousands of years to go back to time to do a time where we 're going to do things like things that are now doing more broadly than
people are watching in their faith in their faith , and so that they tend to be so much that they ca n't be free .
not only the truth is going to use it down .
and listen , everybody 's got to be quite a bit of his opinion , even even though , the right thing to be really true to his opinion , is going to be true to progress .
but you know what they 're not right ?
they do n't have a right on the order of facts , and they 're <unknown> , they do n't have a lot of the things .
and i was trying to make a while to try to figure out that to figure out that way to figure out that .
about a decade of a decade , i 've been a paper about <unknown> about `` the new yorker '' '' was a small article .
and i was amazed to conserve , in the resistance of what 's the most important thing in the end of the most important point in the health care of the human condition .
i did n't know what i was trying to do , so i just did i do , i did what i did have , i wrote a paper and i was going to go back and write .
and soon , soon , i had to write a paper about a <unknown> article on <unknown> food .
the same thing , just bigger , and bigger , bigger than a bigger thing .
people were nuts .
so i wrote a great article , and i could n't understand why people thought that the best thing was that they were all the characteristics of a <unknown> rather than a <unknown>
but you know , i know what i do . i wrote the article , i made the paper , and i made it on it .
i mean , i mean , i 'm a journalist journalist , i 'm a journalist ,
we 're going to give us a <unknown> , we 're going to eat food , so that 's okay .
but this article made me worried about it , and i could n't figure out how to show , why i could n't see why , and eventually , and eventually , i found it out of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of this , and then i found it out .
and that 's because this <unknown> <unknown> , which i did n't have me to do not me , and i did n't have no <unknown> on the <unknown> .
these were <unknown> people , people , people , <unknown> people , <unknown> people .
they were exactly like the people in the room in this room .
and so , what took me that kind of <unknown> ...
but then i thought , well , i thought , what we 're really wrong is we honestly believe .
we 've come to one point where we 're not just the same creative response to progress , as i did , as i would like , as i would , and in the way , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the way .
we 're talking about it all over the <unknown> .
we worry about it , we 're talking about how small <unknown> is about how small <unknown> is about `` <unknown> , '' progress .
okay , so for this , it 's reasons that i think we know , and i think that knowledge are .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science of all , you have no idea why not should be .
you can just give you some names , and you can get to understand .
chernobyl , <unknown> , <unknown> , the <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , the <unknown> of the room 2000 ,
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people who we thought they were always right to be , they are really excited . be great , so they 're skeptical .
so , you ask , you want to choose the evidence of the evidence of , you want to argue , you have a chance of , you want to pay attention to the embarrassment of the idea .
do n't take any of you to buy a bad thing .
but now , this is where you have the evidence of the evidence that you have to look at these evidence , and we 're not good .
and i can tell you that we 're now going to now live in a epidemic of fear , like i never know , and hopefully never see it , and hopefully never , again , never hit the back again .
over 12 years ago , a story published published , a horrible story , a horrible story that was the <unknown> story that was the <unknown> <unknown> , and <unknown> <unknown> in <unknown> .
very scary .
so studies have developed studies that are happening to see whether it was the case of the way that it was about it .
so studies have developed these special models to be done ; that 's a serious business issue .
the data came in in the data .
the data came out of the united states , from england , sweden , from canada , and they were all of the same , no religion , no <unknown> , no
it does n't matter . it does n't matter whether it 's empathy that we think we think we can understand what we see is that we can feel what we 're really wrong with us .
we do n't believe the empirical documents of a <unknown> <unknown> , who are now thinking data , and i understand that , i think we all do it all .
but you know what ?
the result of this was a <unknown> of the object .
<unknown> because of this fact : the u.s. is one of the only two countries on the world where the <unknown> <unknown> is <unknown> for <unknown> <unknown> .
this is <unknown> and we 're going to be ashamed of being a lot of us .
it 's horrible .
what happens is that we could do that , we could do this .
well , i understand that . i understand that . i do .
because then someone remembers <unknown> <unknown> ?
have a single one of the audience who have seen the <unknown> of the children die of bed ?
it 's not often often .
if you do n't look at this country at all the world , but it also shows that in the world , and historically , on the world , over the world last year , and in the last year , the year 2000 .
these are many deaths from <unknown> , 20 per hour .
but because it 's not happening here , we can use it , and people like ted <unknown> are <unknown> and <unknown> messages , fear and <unknown> of <unknown> , <unknown> and <unknown> king live <unknown> .
and you can do it because they do n't think they 're not going to connect and do n't connect to us , and we do n't connect to each other and trust , not <unknown> .
they do n't understand that these things seem to be right , but almost never , the only thing they are .
and that 's something that we have to learn to do , and that 's very quickly , and it 's very quickly , quickly too fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unknown> <unknown> .
he <unknown> us from one of the worst <unknown> of humanity .
no fear , no <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , gone , gone .
the guy in the middle of the guy did n't so much , as the way .
it 's called <unknown> paul <unknown> .
he just just went through a couple of other people who developed a <unknown> <unknown> .
he can transform the life of <unknown> , who are saving 25,000 people spend a thousand dollars a year in the developing world in the developing world .
pretty good , right ?
well , that 's good , except that we 're going to talk about how to walk around and talk about how we talk about how we 're going to say , how valuable it is , and that people are simply to stop .
and he says he 's going to say like this .
so , a writer is , a traditional one .
if paul <unknown> in a public <unknown> , he ca n't write a <unknown> with his <unknown> .
he 's going to get out of the <unknown> because people would love to tell him the story of telling him that they know what he would know where his children are going to school .
and why ? because paul has a <unknown> .
i do n't need to say that , but we can use problems , but technology is essential to solve .
if you 're going to take them , they 're going to go to the diseases , terrible diseases , terrible disease , and that 's happening right now .
we 've been <unknown> in this country now , now , in the country , now we 're now going to be now in this country .
and that 's worse , and pretty soon , going to be a lot of children , when you 're dying of , you know , that 's just a question of the numbers .
and they 're not only dying of <unknown> <unknown> .
what about <unknown> ? do we take this . why do we take this . why not ? why not ?
a <unknown> of mine wrote me a few weeks ago and said , `` i think i 'm a little bit more freaking out of a <unknown> .
nobody had ever told that ever since the time .
it would n't be her <unknown> against her cancer , and not if you were n't fighting against the <unknown> , and no longer .
block .
why ? because we do n't have <unknown> <unknown> . and you know what ?
we did n't have any <unknown> in this country in the country at the country at the country , and we had no <unknown> <unknown> in this country .
today , i do n't know , maybe that 's a morning in hospitals in the airplane in a plane and just <unknown> home , again , he 's talking about the guardian .
and in a few hours , he 's turning it and a car that he 's going to go , and he comes up to long time , and he 's going to go one of this <unknown> <unknown> years ago .
and he does n't know he 's infected with a <unknown> disease , and we do n't know that , because the work is going to go to the world .
this is the planet that we live life . do n't we do it , if it 's not that we do n't it .
we love it to lie to lie . we love this .
have you have all every day today , you 're all covering hip-hop today today , so far the <unknown> of the world today , you 've got to get rid of the vitamins today ?
<unknown> , a small <unknown> <unknown> that 's help to help them all the lesion .
i know that they did this because the half of americans americans are doing this every day .
they take the stuff , and they take a chainsaw compassionate , and it does n't mean , and they do n't know how much of the things we 're learning is that they are concerned about them .
the data shows that all the data is all about the world all over the world .
they 're doing their own . they never waited more .
so , okay , so you want to have 28 <unknown> dollars dollars in ordinary wealthy to pay distant galaxies .
i agree with the completely .
dark levels . dark .
why do we do this ? why do we do this ? why do we do it ?
well , i think i think i understand -- we hate the power of food systems .
we hate to have a strong government . we have no trust trust to us , we have no confidence to be a system .
and so , we should n't do it . we should n't be our business system . our health care system is <unknown> .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing , cold , <unknown> self , to make it possible , which can afford to afford it .
so we 're going to go from the way , and where are we going to start to , and where do we go ?
we 're going to start in the poor of the <unknown> .
this is great . i love the <unknown> <unknown> .
but you know , it 's really a serious problem , because the stuff is <unknown> , and we 're going to be billions of dollars a year .
and i 've all all sorts of little pieces of paper .
none of them -- <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , i do n't know what it is , but we 're going to be billions of dollars for it , it 's been a
and you know what ? when i say , `` people say , people say , and say , `` what would you do ? ' people do ? let 's do what they want .
so they feel good .
and you know what you know ? they 're wrong .
because it 's true to me , whether it 's the medical school , '' says , `` um , i 'm not going to hypothesize that i do n't believe the principle of my origins , '' or some <unknown> , who 's going to do to help the patient with the patient 's students .
if you 're in this way , where do you create the way that you can think and think of the <unknown> and science , you can be in a place where you want to be .
they 're trying to <unknown> to <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 people 's because he was that there 's the red <unknown> , <unknown> and <unknown> amount more efficient than any drugs that we know that they can recognize that the <unknown> of aids .
hundreds of thousands of congolese <unknown> spends death in one country , which is worse than any other of the disease , are more than any other of these diseases of <unknown> disease .
do n't say , do n't tell you that these things have no consequences .
they have . they have been done . they 've done it .
now the <unknown> epidemic , where we 're right now is this ridiculous struggle between the <unknown> <unknown> between the <unknown> <unknown> food and the <unknown> .
this is a <unknown> debate . it 's going to stop .
it 's a debate about words , which is about existing , and the absence of words .
this is an argument , it 's an idea , is n't science science .
everything we eat , every <unknown> , every alien <unknown> , every <unknown> , has been changed by the people , were <unknown> from the people .
you know , there was no <unknown> in the garden .
there was no <unknown> <unknown> .
there was no <unknown> . we made it all together .
we did it in the last 28 years .
and some of them have been done and do n't work and do n't quite well .
we 've lost in what it was n't , what has happened to work .
now we can do it , and of course , there are risks . but we can do something like a lot of rice , and that 's a little bit more than people to help millions of people , and
do n't want to make it not ?
i have to say , i do n't say , i do n't understand .
we <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
why do we do this ?
now , what i 'm going to tell is , like hundreds of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , we do n't want to have huge massive fields with a thing , that 's wrong .
we do n't want to know that companies live a normal place .
we do n't want to add companies that have seeds every single one .
and you know what i mean , my favorite of all is that ?
yes , they 're right . configure the action . we define that . we define that .
it 's true , we 're really going to have a huge <unknown> , but it 's not science , but that 's not science .
that has nothing to do with science .
it 's right , morality , <unknown> , <unknown> .
you know that the science is not a company .
it 's not a country . it 's not a country .
it 's not one idea . she 's a process ; she 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it 's and not , but the idea that we should n't need to do the work for us to do their work , because they fear us into a <unknown> , and she invites millions of people from the
you know , in the next 50 years , we 'll be 70 percent of food , more than more than 70 . 70 percent .
this investment in africa has been in the last 30 years in the last 30 years .
a magic is scary . a magic .
they need that , and we do n't give it to them .
and why ? appachan <unknown> <unknown> .
we do n't want to encourage people to eat that <unknown> stuff , '' for example , like <unknown> <unknown> .
<unknown> is something that <unknown> a half of people , as a dollar people , and as a half people , '' and a half people eat a billion people .
it 's like a payoff . it 's like a condom .
it 's just a bunch of calories , it 's worth it . it 's worth up .
it has no nutrients , it has no protein , and scientists , and we have no protein , and scientists are building all the protein and just new stuff on this .
and then people would have the food and then they could n't be blind to the same time .
they would n't be injured , and you know what ?
this would be beautiful . it would n't be <unknown> <unknown> , but it would be beautiful <unknown> , but it would be beautiful .
and all i 'm going to say is : why are we fighting this ?
i mean , why do we say , why are we going to do ? why do we do that ?
because we do n't want to want to want to make a <unknown> <unknown> ?
it 's not about making genes , and it 's not about chemicals . it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about a simple passion for hormones , our existence on electricity food , better food , better food , <unknown> food .
it 's not about migraine <unknown> , it 's about being able to get people to live , and it 's going to understand the time to understand what it means .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do that if we make more and so much , we do n't think about a lot of us , which we think is not to ask about , not <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> .
there 's no other description of what 's going to do what 's happening here is what 's happening here .
it 's cheap , it 's ugly , it 's ugly , and it 's not our <unknown> , and we have to really do it really .
so after this incredibly weird , you want to be a little bit of a way to say , `` do you want to still go to this <unknown> and more and see in the <unknown> and more ? ''
in fact , that 's what i want to remember . everybody wants to say on every case .
right now , in the moment , you 're in the present , but we have a incredible opportunity to do it , and we have a incredible opportunity to do it .
we can now take this time on all the time to do what we want to do .
we can actually turn them to where we want them to be <unknown> , and we 're going to move them , we 're going to move them , we 're going to move it , where we want to do .
we need to get this conversation , and we need to think , but if we go to the time and then go into the time and the way we will be happy to have this , and i 'm happy to have done that .
i know that we can do , and as soon as it 's all we 've been looking at , and as soon as it 's something that we 're going to do is something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for a while , i 'm interested in the <unknown> . it 's very strange that a question of the interest is to be , and i think it looks like me , `` a deception that will be safe enough to know if you 're
in other words , <unknown> <unknown> has a huge effect , a <unknown> , and it 's because of course , a <unknown> , or a <unknown> , like the patient , you know , if you 're going to see the
a deception is going to be something that is a real way , because someone is so much like this .
so we can also give them two things to be , i want to show you a fundamental thing , a simple magic game .
and i 'm going to show you how he works . this is a trick that is at least in the 1950s , at least in the 1950s , at least the <unknown> in every <unknown> for children .
i even had it to introduce him to the <unknown> <unknown> magic cartoon of the <unknown> , and i learned learned how we learned in the 1970s .
i 'm going to make it for you , and i 'll explain to you and explain to explain it .
and i 'm going to explain why why i 'm going to explain why i 'm going to explain him .
so , look at what happens .
the knife that you can do is , the knife that you can study , my hand that you can study to work .
i 'm going to be able to keep the knife just like me , in my head .
i <unknown> back to the e .
and to ensure that nothing in my sleeve , or from the edge of the observation , i 'm just going to just look at my wrist at the top of this picture .
in this way , you can see that it 's a little bit more about anything else . i 'm working on here , and i 'm going to go to see in a taxi in my waist and never come to the end of
and the goal is just a simple way , and it 's just easy to just do it .
i 'm going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all of the good , '' so if all the time is good , it 's a knife , <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> .
it actually actually is in the place where there 's a way of <unknown> that i can get it to accept that , because it 's the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
nothing in my fortunes or coming out , `` no , no <unknown> , and you can study things .
<unknown> !
now , this is a trick that i often do to work for love , but you can also do so much about critical , if you think , in a moment , you think , in a moment , you can think of a moment of <unknown> , even though it 's a very <unknown> trick .
probably many of you know , many of you know , in the way , you know , many of you here in the room is going to be this one here in the room .
so this is what it works .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say i 'm going to come up my wrist , i could try to ensure that anything in my sperm 's desk or <unknown> , and that 's a lie .
the reason i have my crazy idea of the fact is that that is the very secret to the object of illusion , which is the actual secret of illusion .
in the moment , where i 'm going to do my hand , you can see them from the back , you will see this finger , i was in a position where he was so <unknown> .
great trick ?
and at night , back in the back , there was no one that was n't a childhood kid .
so , here 's what we are here . exactly . exactly . right .
and if i 'm <unknown> , i 'm going to change my own position , the check your finger .
and now , you might talk about why this is an obvious thing , you know , you 're not thinking that you 're just seeing the finger , you know , the way and the way that the information and the way it is a difference , we 're not just
but that 's not quite a moment now , so here 's the moment , and then i 'll put my hand up on my hand .
of course , it 's going to take it , but not by the <unknown> of my body , but by a trick , through my <unknown> , which is now available now .
and if i take my hand , i would go back to the same way , when i 'm going to go back , i 'm going to come through this movement , and the light is <unknown> , and the <unknown> is a <unknown> .
i take this hand away . and here 's the date . here 's the knife .
and so , this trick is to give your friends and my steps , thank you . thank you . thank you . thank you . thank you . thank you . thank you .
now , what does this do with the <unknown> ?
a year ago , or so , i read a study that really really really <unknown> me , really , really , really really really really really really <unknown> me .
i 'm not a doctor or a scientist , and so i was fortunate for a brilliant thing .
it 's what happens is : if you 're going to give a <unknown> in a form of a black ball , in the form of a <unknown> , it 's just a set of <unknown> , which is a prototype , white hole that have a <unknown>
but if you look at the shape , it 's the <unknown> for the way to change a smaller pill , and that blue <unknown> and a letter to the <unknown> , and they 're actually <unknown> a
and that , although no , if nothing <unknown> anything -- if it 's just <unknown> -- it 's just <unknown> .
but a white ball is n't as good as a light ball as a light ball , and it 's a very clear pill .
what ? the fact that really did me feel crazy .
but it turns out that it did n't matter anything that 's not all .
if you take care of the <unknown> , the <unknown> is more <unknown> than any other every woman .
a <unknown> who 's sitting at a end of the yellow and a small <unknown> and the other is a little <unknown> , and it 's better than a white atom .
the <unknown> also has a role in a field of education , and it 's a role in a context of a role model .
a ball twice a few times less than three pills -- i ca n't remember the exact <unknown> of the music . sorry , sorry .
but the critical thing is , ... ...
... so that also , the way that the play play is a kind of play , and the most <unknown> brain works a role .
and the shape is a role .
and if you want to call the ultimate <unknown> , you have to take your needle and take your needle , please .
right ? a crow 's <unknown> with a <unknown> -- a few <unknown> of a <unknown> substance that you could make a patient in a patient 's <unknown> , which you have a patient .
that creates a very strong image in the head . it 's very much more powerful than a chemical ball .
this graph is really exciting -- i 'll show you a different way to show you if we have a <unknown> , you know , if we have a <unknown> .
so , the fact that the white pill would n't like that as the blue pill that does n't really look like a little bit like a tenth of what the polar bear that did n't seem like this as the needle .
and nothing about this has a very strong property . it 's just our ability to make sure that we 're going to be a <unknown> effect of us , and have a more efficient effect .
i wanted to know if i could take this idea to a magic player might be a <unknown> magic .
i 'll do something that 's obvious , which is an illusion , and we 're going to look really cool .
we know from the study that you have to take a needle if you want to go to the one .
this is a 18 inches long <unknown> . it 's very , very <unknown> , and i 'm going to take it a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
this is really my meat , and it 's not <unknown> <unknown> of <unknown> meat meat , meat , meat , meat , meat , meat , meat , meat , meat , meat , meat , meat , meat , meat , meat , meat , meat , meat , meat , meat , meat , meat , meat , meat , meat , meat , meat .
this is my skin . this is not a <unknown> , which is not a <unknown> <unknown> from hollywood .
i 'm going to now open this needle in my skin and put them through it , and then we go to the one that we 're going to go back to the other side .
if you 're bad at the time -- if you 're just in <unknown> -- i 've got a few friends friends in the hotel , and some people i did n't know , and that 's a woman 's <unknown> .
so i 'm going to conclude if you 're going to be bad , you 'll look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i 'm going to do the first <unknown> of the first step of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the
you can see it right now , you can also do it also , but you can also do it as if you want to do it , if you want to do it , if you want to do it .
so , it 's so where i was like , the ones , i 'm going to start to <unknown> the bottom of my <unknown> , i 'm just going to make a little bit of <unknown> <unknown> .
i 'm sorry . am i wrong with crazy !
and just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of my skin and on the other side of the skin , and on the other side of the other side , so that 's what we 've done is .
now , we 're actually in the same situation that we 've had the same situation that we had in the <unknown> , and we 've been able to do it in the <unknown> .
it 's about how much .
but now you can not count the finger , but you do n't think of it ?
so , i 'm going to show you to show you . that 's one , two , three , four , five , five .
well , so , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well
i know what people think about if you see this , you can see this .
they say , `` okay , this is not such appropriate to the feeling of <unknown> and <unknown> himself the way to just give us a few minutes of all . ''
now , i 'll show you a little bit .
what does this mean ? what 's it right ? so good .
yes , i know .
and people who say , `` okay , i 'm okay . okay . i did n't see it right . i did n't have seen right now . ''
people are in the middle of the <unknown> now , in the <unknown> , they 've been <unknown> in the <unknown> , and then the people are now coming in .
let me show you some of the things that you 've seen you .
this is really my skin . it 's not a skin . it 's not a <unknown> <unknown> from hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can keep the <unknown> effect .
sorry . when you 're bad , you 're bad , look at you , look at the way , do n't look at you , look at it .
the people in the first place , or the ones that eventually come up at video , say , `` well , this is really a very nice thing , but if it was real , he would be -- there 's a hole and there 's a hole and then
okay , let me just take a little blood flow of it , you know , just open you for you .
yes , it 's all there .
i would just use the needle through the only way .
i would be the same of the future , and i show you that there 's no such <unknown> peanuts .
but i think , in this frame here , and with the intention of doing something , but a deception to do something , it will just be able to take the needle and go from the stage .
we 're going to give us a few days in the next few days .
i hope you all love you all , thank you very much .
everybody 's talking about happiness today , and happiness is about happiness .
i 've got some people who are missing the number of books , which is called `` <unknown> , '' in the <unknown> over the last five years , and they gave birth to 40 , and there was a lot more about .
there 's a huge wave of the interest of happiness , and happiness , happiness , thankfully , perhaps in the previous number of researchers .
there 's a lot of <unknown> <unknown> .
everybody would like to make the happier lot .
but even despite all of these creeks , you have several cognitive <unknown> , which is the same thing that it might be almost bad , but it 's also about thinking about happiness .
and my talk today is going to be mainly by this cognitive settings .
it 's for the <unknown> that <unknown> your own happiness , and it 's also for the reason that scientists think about happiness , because it turns out that we are just like anything like each other than everyone else .
the first of these are <unknown> , this is a <unknown> , which is a <unknown> , which is a <unknown> , which is the <unknown> of the following imagination to be a powerful idea .
it turns out that the word is just a useful word for a <unknown> word , because we can use it to different kinds of different things .
i think there 's a certain meaning that we could call it , but in the big , and all of the things we need to say , and we 're going to be able to think of the complicated perspective , which is , what 's
the second thing is a very good way , and the way , basically basically , is that they 're both happy in their lives and happy to be alive , and thank you all the life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they 're both <unknown> in the idea of happiness , and the ones that happiness is happiness .
and the third one is the <unknown> , and that 's the most powerful fact that we can not be thinking about , but that 's a sense of the ability to think about the very fundamental way to predict the importance of a simple self , without its understanding .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there 's no way to get it away from the right thing to get out of the right .
now , i 'd like to start with a example of someone who had a <unknown> , one <unknown> -- `` yes ... he said he 'd had a <unknown> , and it was absolutely amazing music , and it was absolutely amazing music sound , and it was
and then he <unknown> , really , really , emotionally , really , emotionally , that bothers the whole experience of being lost .
but it did n't have .
what was the mistake was the <unknown> was all the memory of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had 20 years of <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> music .
they do n't use it because he was a <unknown> , and the memory was <unknown> , and the memory was hopelessly , and the memory was everything he had to get to do .
what 's really , what we really say is that we 're talking about ourselves and more other people , we know , in other ways of two types of self .
there 's a <unknown> of people who live in the present and the present knowledge is able to find the past again , but in the present , but basically only the present has been .
it 's the <unknown> of the people who <unknown> the doctor -- you know if the doctor asks , `` do n't it if you 're going to <unknown> it up ? ''
and then there 's a <unknown> self , and the <unknown> self is that you go to the world 's office and the story that the doctor 's office with the question of the question , `` how did you feel good at the time ? ''
or , `` how was your journey to albania ? '' or it 's like , and so similar .
these are two very different entities , which is <unknown> , and the <unknown> self , and the <unknown> itself is , and the two way to be part of the <unknown> of the <unknown> of the happiness .
now , the <unknown> self is a storyteller .
and this really really begins with a fundamental response of our memories -- it starts instantly .
we do n't tell you stories , if we 're not talking about stories , to tell us to tell stories about all the stories .
our memory tells us all the time , what we call them our skills , we can keep our own stories .
and let 's go through a <unknown> .
there 's a old study .
these are real patients who have a few other surgery to create a painful , and i 've got a lot of time that we 've been doing , and i 've got to do it again .
i 'm not going to go into the details . it 's not more painful , but it was painful , when he started to have been a <unknown> when this study had been taken in the 1990s .
they were asked to help all the 60 seconds to talk about their pain .
and here 's two patients , and these are their records .
and they 're asked , `` who was given to each one ?
and that 's a very simple question .
patient have had been done before . his <unknown> was longer a long time , and every time of pain that had a chance to have had had a chance to have a product accident , and more .
but now there 's another question : `` how much would like to spend that patients do n't have this ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient has a kind of <unknown> <unknown> on the <unknown> accident , which is a patient b to the bottom line .
the stories of the <unknown> were <unknown> , and because a very important part of the story is how they went up to the same time as she was .
and no of these stories are very <unknown> or beautiful -- but great of them is one that is that this is why this is a clear ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the other ones .
and the death of the surprise was the where i had the very end of the end on the end on his end , and it 's a <unknown> story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked people to ask them to their <unknown> , and much more later , `` how bad that was all of all the time in all ? ''
and it was much worse than a matter of a b in the <unknown> area .
well , that 's a <unknown> conflict between the <unknown> self and the <unknown> itself .
from the <unknown> of the <unknown> himself , this has clearly been a clear time of accident , and a few time time , and there 's a time of time .
now , what you could do with patient 's hand , and we actually started experimenting with experiments , and it works , you could actually take a <unknown> of a <unknown> by a <unknown> by <unknown>
that 's what 's the patient , and the patient , and just a little bit more and much less than more than the other thing before .
and if you make a few minutes long , the power of self is a bad thing , and you have to make the difference in the patient 's worth better , because you have patient 's spending a better story about his experience .
what 's life about a story ?
and that 's for the stories that memory is the ability to make us , and it 's also for the stories that we feel .
and what a story is a <unknown> <unknown> , which is <unknown> , <unknown> moments and <unknown> .
part of the very very , very important , and in fact , that 's important , and in this case , the <unknown> <unknown> believed the end .
now , the <unknown> self is alive to be alive alive for life , and he 's always being alive to live alive .
it has moments of <unknown> , one of the <unknown> , one of the other one , as a different way , i 've got one other thing to do .
and they ask , what 's what happens to that ?
and the answer is very simple . they 're lost that forever always have always been always forever forever .
i mean , most of our babies today -- and i 've done this -- the present present is , like , three years of you . it 's about that a lot of them have about a million years of it . in a month , there 's about 13 .
most of them are completely <unknown> from the <unknown> self itself .
and yet they 're going to have a sense that they should count , that should be happening , that 's what happens during this moments of <unknown> , that our life is going to be our life .
it 's the fun resource that we 're using as we 're using as we 're using as we 're doing in this world .
and as we used to use them , they would be able to be important , but that 's not the story that the <unknown> itself is the <unknown> of the <unknown> itself to our own food for us .
so we 've got the <unknown> , and the <unknown> self itself , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between you , the one of the other is the one of the time of the time with the time , and the one of the time of the time with the time , is the way of work .
from the point of view , when you have a shower , you have a shower , and the second week we are so good as well as the first , the <unknown> <unknown> is <unknown> as well as the <unknown> meal <unknown> as well as a
so , this is not all the way that all the time of self 's <unknown> himself does n't mean .
for the <unknown> self , it 's a <unknown> facility , hardly <unknown> <unknown> , if you 're going to be <unknown> , because there 's no new memories of being <unknown> .
they did n't have the history , they changed the story .
and so , in this way , the real surprise , the critical existence that a <unknown> itself differently is a different self , even a sense of a sense of time , and even a little influence in this story .
now , the <unknown> self itself is more than just remember , remember and tell stories about all the time .
it 's actually the way that we make decisions that , because if you have a patient , you know , we can have two <unknown> , two , who has n't been able to choose , he 's trying to figure out the <unknown> that the people who are doing
the <unknown> self does n't have voice voice , but even though , in the choice , '' there 's a voice in this choice .
we do n't think we do n't choose between the other thing . we do n't choose to look at memories of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we think , we think , perhaps , in the future , we do n't usually have our most important way to our future as well as well .
we think about our future as we were <unknown> memory for the future of <unknown> behavior .
and basically , you can see that , you know , if you take a <unknown> of the <unknown> , and you can think about the <unknown> self , as you know , the way that means that the <unknown> itself has <unknown> to work with experience the <unknown> itself .
i have the idea that if we 're proposing a very much the case , it means that we 're <unknown> out of the food industry , the <unknown> of the <unknown> itself .
and that 's a little hard hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much livestock we 're from from the memories of our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that 's the <unknown> of the <unknown> itself is a given point .
and if i think about it , i think of a graduate school that we 've done a few years ago , the obvious thing i was ever had , and i 'm also going to see a lot of how i think about how many ideas i think about how to
and i probably probably know about the memories of my view , i would say , i think , i would say , 25 years ago , i would say , 25 years ago , i 'd say , 25 years in the last four years .
now , if i ever had the <unknown> , i 'd have to spend a series of a hundred minutes of the digital pictures of the way i 'd spent a couple of hour ago .
now , these are three weeks ago , and those are three hours of hours of a few hours .
there 's a moment to make a disconnect on a spacewalk .
now , i like a very scary , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , how little <unknown> , i have a lot of a lot of the world . why are we going to start to make sure so much weight weight on the weight of the weight that we
so i want you to think about that , i want to think about a thought of thinking about a thought of thinking about this experiment .
imagine your next drop , you know that at the end of the <unknown> , all of the <unknown> , everyone will get their pictures on the top , and they get a <unknown> drug that they would never know whether they 're never going to remember .
now , would you ever choose the same chairman of sign ?
and if you elect a certain species , you have a conflict between your two different locations , and you have to think about how to make this conflict , and it 's really not just a <unknown> , because if you think of the sense of memory , and if you think of the sense of memory , you can think
why we choose the <unknown> that we can have a problem that is , again , is a sense that we imagine , with a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two species of which is , and the two species of the periphery of the top of the two <unknown> of happiness is the same thing as well .
there 's actually a bunch of concepts that we can use , is a <unknown> , we can use , a fraction of us can be one another , and a penny .
so you can ask : how happy is the happy self itself ?
and then they would ask , how happy are the moments of life in the life of the <unknown> itself ?
and they 're all right -- happiness is a very complicated process of a unique process , and it 's a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we 're now able to do a pretty good idea of the happiness of the <unknown> itself , and the time of the time .
if you ask the time you 're at the end of the <unknown> self , it 's a very different thing .
it 's not a way to make a happy living in a person .
it 's a feeling like <unknown> or <unknown> , that person is , if this person is , when this person thinks about it all the time you think of your life is better thinking about it .
very different evidence .
everyone who does n't know this kind of <unknown> , and how to find the way of happiness , and i 'm a lot of a lot of researchers about learning that well-being that have been able to have the most remarkable picture of the same time for
the distinction between the happiness of the <unknown> and the happiness of the <unknown> , has been found in the last years , and now they 're going to measure the two <unknown> habit .
the <unknown> organization has a global survey , which is more than a half million people , are given what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there was other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started starting to talk about how many of the numbers of all of these two kinds of individual things , to learn how to share with the other species of the other .
and the <unknown> lesson we 've learned , i think , is that they 're really different .
you can know how talented with your life is , and that 's not really much about how much it is much of how much it is alive and lives .
just to give you a sense of the temptation to determine the consumer lobes is the <unknown> of the <unknown> .
what that means is that if you were to give someone somebody and you would say , `` oh , my father is a <unknown> , how much would you know ? how much would you know about it ?
now , you would know something about his greatness , but there 's a lot of uncertainty , but there 's much more involved .
they have so much of the uncertainty .
if i say to you that someone will be life for a number of eight <unknown> , which has been much a lot of uncertainty , how happy he 's with his <unknown> self .
so what 's the particle is the sheer is so much of the things is that small is all very small .
we know something about what the happiness is about , the order of the <unknown> <unknown> is about .
we know that money is very important to be beneficial , that are important important to be beneficial .
we know that happiness is really important to be with people with people that we like to talk to people with people we like .
there are other words , but that 's a very good job , but it 's a very good job .
so if you want to think about the happiness of the individual , you will want to do some of the things all the things you can do , you know , you can do , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it 's very different things .
and what i 'm talking about is that i 'm talking about , we 're not really lucky to be thinking about whether it 's a direct way to well-being than a performance for well-being .
it 's a completely different term , and it 's a completely different word .
well , very quickly , another reason that we ca n't think about happiness is that we do n't think about the same things if we think about life and change in our life , and if we actually live .
so if you take the simple question , how happy people in california , they 're not going to be the right answer .
if you think that question is , you think that people will be in china 's going to be in the happier as if you 're , we say , in the traditional sectors .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , we can say , in the climate , we say ,
well , it turns out that climate is not important to the <unknown> self , and it 's not even a matter for the <unknown> self , which is what it 's like , how many people are .
now , because the <unknown> self is in the way , you can actually do some of the people -- some people could be able to go to california .
and it 's kind of useful for what happens with people who are <unknown> to california , and will be easier to be happier .
now , your <unknown> self is not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . and you think that they 're happier , because if you 're going to be aware of how it 's the weather of the minister in the shipyard . and you 're feeling that you 've been able to be
it 's very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i hope i 've been showing you a sense of how it tells you how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you very much .
now , when we took a few weeks , you 've got to think that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this <unknown> survey , which came out of this <unknown> survey .
is that something that you can do in common , because what 's going to have been a couple of years to you have a few minutes ?
daniel <unknown> : sure .
i think the most intriguing result that we 've seen in the <unknown> survey is a number that we have n't expected to find out of it .
we found that in the most important thing about happiness , and even the way of the self itself .
when we looked at how nature relates to the income , '' and <unknown> .
and it turns out income is about income income , 60,000 dollars a year , americans , and that 's a very large sample of americans , about 12 , but it 's a big health discussion , and there 's a big health fingerprint ,
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 countries , 60,000 , 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in year has people unhappy unhappy and they 're increasingly more common than they 're getting less likely to be the way they 're going to be , as much as they will .
we 're going to get a completely flat line here , there 's a total flat line here .
i mean , i 'm sure i 'm hardly seen here in blue lines , and you can see that mountain lines lines .
what happens is , there 's no reason , is n't it to be a <unknown> , but that lack of money from a few of them are certainly <unknown> , and we can actually apply this misery to very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the <unknown> self , the other self , you take another story .
the more money you need the people you have the people you have the people .
that 's not the emotions .
but danny , in the entire american endeavor , it 's all about living , freedom , the <unknown> , to be part of the <unknown> , to be a <unknown> , and <unknown> .
if people would say that , i mean , it 's like to think it 's going to be able to pay it on the head , all that we believe in the way that we think , for <unknown> and so on .
is there a chance that that country has a <unknown> like a <unknown> like the <unknown> , and how do we do that , if we would do that , if we would do to believe ?
dk : you know , i think that there 's a sense of belief for the role of the <unknown> in the economy of politics .
the recipe will be slowly in the united states , not to ask , but in the united kingdom , it 's just happening and in other countries , it 's just happening .
the people are , they know , they may think they should think of happiness , if they think about politics , believe that we are thinking about politics .
it 's going to take a while , and people will be familiar whether or we want to explore the way of <unknown> , or whether you want to explore the way more broadly , so we have to get this discussion soon soon .
as happiness is capable of getting closer to how you think , think of thinking about it , if you think about the <unknown> themselves or , if you think about the <unknown> themselves , or if you think about the <unknown> itself .
that will be changing politics , i think , well , in the next few years , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , we 've been able to measure the <unknown> to measure the <unknown> of the population .
this is what i 'm going to do , i think , in the next few years , two decades of the national canyon .
well , it seems to me that this issue is , and , in fact , i think , is to least be the most important application of the <unknown> , and then , if you 're only going to be the next few years . ''
thank you very much for the invention of memes .
thank you , danny <unknown> <unknown> .
i 'm a writer , jane , i 'm playing <unknown> , i 'm playing video games . i 'm playing video games .
i 'm now translating for a hundred years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in reality , how to save in
i have a plan for this . i want to convince people more , you all have to spend more time with a little bit of time and spend games play with a little bit of play .
now , we 're going to spend three billion hours of a week , a mile number of hours a week with <unknown> <unknown> per week .
so , some of you might think , `` this is a whole bunch of time for games , and i 'm going to be a lot of time . ''
maybe something else is , if we 're using some of the problems of problems , we have the impact of the real world in the world , and we have the test of the real world .
but in fact , my research on the center of the national contribution , is the opposite , is the opposite <unknown> .
three billion hours per week are not close to enough to make the problems of solving the world of the world .
in fact , i believe that if we want to take our next century on this planet , we need to have to use this time , that we can use this time ,
i 've done that the fact that the drone is about the 21st century of africa , a year 's <unknown> per week .
now , this may be something very simple , so i 'm going to put it to the way we can do : if we should solve problems like hunger , global , global , global medicine and loss , i think we need to try to play
no , i mean , i mean , really , i mean , really , i mean , really , i mean , really , i mean , really , i mean , really , really , i mean , really , really , i mean , really , really , really , i mean , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really
why ? this image really looks really fascinating why i believe that games are so important for the survival of human species in the future . equity .
this is a tudor of the photographers who are <unknown> at the 1930s of <unknown> <unknown> .
he wanted to make the feelings of play , and so he 's made a camera in the eye , and then he had a <unknown> of a camera .
this is one of the classic verb that play play is the play .
if you 're not a player , you can hear some of the fates , you might recognize some of the <unknown> of the <unknown> in this picture .
you can probably see this sense of urgency , which is fear , but also , you can also feel very carefully , even by a way of a sense of a sense of a sense of a real problem of a better problem .
if you 're playing , you see some of the winners of the morning , the eyes of eyes , and the mouth is a sign of optimism , and the notes are very clear .
this is a player that 's the player that comes to the edge of a <unknown> <unknown> is a <unknown> <unknown> .
oh , you know . -- well , fine . so we have some players to get together .
a <unknown> victory is a result that is so very positive , that it 's not very good that you did n't know that it was possible , that it was possible possible .
it was almost almost about the rest of the imagination .
and if you do it , it 's shocked , they 're shocked to be able to make something that could be done , and this is a <unknown> victory .
this player has a quick victory of a <unknown> victory before a <unknown> .
and this is what we need to see in the whole world of <unknown> on the world , if we take the <unknown> of the next century , the face of which that gave me the <unknown> of all the <unknown>
well , unfortunately , we see more of this face in real life , if we 're going to take a lot of problems , we 're better learning .
i call it as the `` i live in bad '' but i 'm a good thing , and it 's actually my face , you see , you know , you 're going to see , you 're right ? yes !
that 's me , i 'm going to make it `` my life i was bad '' in a good job .
this is a graffiti in my early home in berkeley , california , where i was a very early warning of what i 'd better talk about how we 're going to play better than real real life .
this is a problem that 's a problem that have many players players .
we think we think we think we 're not in good reality , so we 're not so good as we play so much like we are playing games .
and i do n't just only have any successful in the case , even though that 's heard about this , although this belongs to this point .
we 're born in <unknown> . i mean my good way to help with the motivation , which is to do something that 's not working with some kinds of experiences , and help people work together .
if we have a <unknown> , i believe that many of us , we have to put our own data in our best version , and we 're going to be able to try and think about it as a problem , to make the problem , and how to make it
and in reality , if we fail , if we fix religion , we feel like a lot of time , we feel like different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel guilty to be . we feel about us , we feel feel about , perhaps depressed -- potentially , optimistic or <unknown> .
so we can do that sense , we do n't know if we 're playing games , we 're playing games , in games , it 's just not just a little bit of time .
and that 's what i wanted to study as a <unknown> , and i 'm kind of <unknown> .
why is it not just play , thinking , you might n't have anything to achieve this ?
how can we make these emotions from the same way that we 're looking for the reality of reality , right ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which is the ideal environment to be the ideal environment to the <unknown> sciences .
and i found a few things that actually realized that the invention of <unknown> <unknown> in the way that you could do , but i could do it possible possible .
so , first , if you 're in a way , the way that you 're doing in the world , in the world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters that are willing to get you to a <unknown> mission , and immediately , instantly immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that makes perfect a little bit of its current level in the game , right ?
so , that 's what it does .
you never would have to be a task that you can not solve .
but even at the edge of your test , so you have to work yourself hard , but there 's no unemployment in india , but there 's no unemployment in india , and in fact , there are the population of warcraft .
you 're not looking at it , and you 're <unknown> , and there 's always a way of a very difficult way to do something to be about a important issue .
and there are millions of thousands of dollars .
where they 're going to go to hundreds of thousands of people who work together to work to <unknown> their own mission .
we do n't have a real life that we do n't just do in the real life , this kind of thing that are making a little healthy chemicals that are <unknown> people .
and also , there 's this epic story , it 's a weekend , and the advent of history , why we are there , why we are there , and what we do , we have to do .
now , we get this whole bunch of feedback .
they 've identified just by the level of `` far , '' and `` communicable meen '' or `` artificial intelligence '' or `` artificial intelligence . ''
this <unknown> , there 's no way of a lot of life , there 's no life in real life .
if i 'm going to leave this stage , i did n't know , `` talk '' and artificial <unknown> idea , <unknown> <unknown> idea , <unknown> <unknown> idea .
i 'm not going to go in real life of this feedback of this feedback .
so the problem of the world 's <unknown> , as natural of warcraft , is that it 's like , sometimes it 's like <unknown> , and to the end of a <unknown> , we 're going to spend our whole time in these <unknown> .
they 're just better than the reality .
until all over the world of <unknown> , all the books of <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> spent all the potential to solve the virtual problems of <unknown> problems .
it 's not necessarily something bad .
it may sound bad evil .
but to think about it in the context : there are two years ago , <unknown> <unknown> years began to go to our first <unknown> .
so the first brain-controlled <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
ok , so if we spend a lot of time , how much of all we 're going to do , is just a way of time , it 's just going to make sense of time , if you 're going to be time , even if you 're going to happen to the moment of the world 's <unknown> , which is extremely powerful .
but also , you know , it 's like that we can use that we can use this whole time , we actually use the whole time , actually , what we can be able to do when people are able to be able to do .
we 're going to develop a lot of us , we 're going to come to each other , and people , we 're taught , you know , are some people , and we 're teaching people , and we 're taught , you know , are people who are in a way .
that 's the truth . i think i was .
and then think of this interesting statistics that recently started to study in a study of university university university : the average young man in africa in the country with large <unknown> spent hours of 10,000 hours a hundred hours to the 21st of the
so , 10,000 hours a number interesting interesting number of new york , and two interesting one of the number two generations : one two , many of the reasons , two dozen things , and in a conversation , i think , two dozen things , and in a conversation , i think , two dozen things , and in a conversation , i think , two reasons .
first of the time , children in the united states is <unknown> hours of the <unknown> that they spend in school , from five of the school , to school , when you never have
so we have a complete <unknown> , which young people learn to figure out what it means to be a good player , how everything else they learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the last book of electroshock <unknown> , called `` <unknown> , '' read .
so she 's talking about his theory of purpose , the theory of the success of the success of the 20th century , for the <unknown> of the 20th century , a mile of the 10,000 hours .
she 's based on the great research of the <unknown> research that that when we spend 10,000 hours with the <unknown> of a human issue to the 21st century , for example , we 're going to be able to make it in a
we 're going to be so good at what we 're doing , whatever we do still do , how do we do , to do whatever the most people of the world is the same people in the world .
so what we have here is a whole generation of young young people who are <unknown> , who are <unknown> .
so the big question is , `` what do you 're really good for good to ? ''
because if we could figure out that , we could n't have any more human <unknown> anymore , but there 's no human ability to solve the human potential .
so many people we have in the world , we 've been able to go to the world where we spend on the next few minutes a day with <unknown> , and i 've been able to spend a <unknown> trip .
these are our <unknown> . in 500 million people that are extraordinary sounds in `` something '' ] something like this .
and the next decade of the first decade , we have a billion billion gamers that seem pretty good in real us , and so forth , whatever it is also , too .
if you 've heard that ever , it 's not heard about it , you have n't heard about it , you have n't heard about it , you 've heard about it , you 've heard about it , you 've heard about it , you 've heard about it , you 've heard about it , you 've heard about it , you 've heard about it , you 've heard about it , you 've heard
the <unknown> technology developed <unknown> , and the energy working on the cost of <unknown> and <unknown> , so the <unknown> , to get the <unknown> of the <unknown> , to be the <unknown> on the world , particularly in india , china , are in online ,
you 'd expect a extra billion players that we 've been going to be successful in the next decade .
we have a <unknown> player for a billion players .
so i started to think what 's going to do , what it is , what 's the things that we 're doing to do this stuff .
here are the four things that i found was , and the first thing is : first of all , <unknown> .
ok , so imagine that as the <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> , and i think that 's very smooth .
<unknown> is the craving to make a little bit more fun to make a picture , to be a picture , with faith that we have a <unknown> hope to succeed .
aaa , always think it 's always possible that a <unknown> device is possible , and it 's always going to be able to try it and try it and i 'm not going to be able to do it .
and i do n't sit there 's a lot of shoes .
players are masters of the <unknown> of a social <unknown> <unknown> .
there 's a lot of interesting , and we can know that we might think people more than after we 've played with them , even if they diverge , why they were afraid of us .
the reason that is that there is a lot of trust to play with a little bit of play with a game .
we 're hoping that every time with the time that we spend a new way of time is that the rules are going to be that we have the same goal , and we can continue to do the <unknown> .
so the usda allows the user , the users are growing all of our skills , trust , trust and others .
as a result , we 're going to build more social relationships with us , and we 're using our social relationships .
<unknown> productivity . fantastic ! fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason why the <unknown> of the hundred of the hundred years of hours 22 hours per week , when we look at a <unknown> , like <unknown> .
the reason is that if we play , we 're really lucky to work hard , when we do n't , or something .
we know that we 're going to work with the human beings , working in the way we work , and we 're very hard to work hard , really , really , really , <unknown> work .
and players are always ready to work hard , working if they get the right thing to do it ?
and finally , in the way , the meaning of the meaning .
aaa players love it to be part of my <unknown> <unknown> of the <unknown> .
here you see a <unknown> , to make the flow of light , you know , all of the wikipedia , you know , people who are the american <unknown> , the largest <unknown> of the world .
the second hadron collider <unknown> in the world , with almost 20 , <unknown> is the world of warcraft <unknown> , and the world of warcraft <unknown> .
five million people use a month every month .
they 've got more information about world from world from warcraft on the internet , more than any other subject in every other <unknown> in every other <unknown> of the world .
they 're creating an ideal story .
they 're creating an expert of knowledge to the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four clips that have to take a whole outcome , and players are <unknown> , <unknown> individuals , romantic individuals , and individuals .
it 's people who believe that they change the other thing as the future , to change the future .
and the only problem is that you believe that you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real world .
this is the problem that i 'm trying to solve all of the things i 'm trying to solve .
now edward <unknown> is a <unknown> <unknown> .
his work is great . he <unknown> why why people are so much time , energy and money in <unknown> <unknown> .
and he says , `` we 're going to see the <unknown> of any less than a <unknown> in virtual worlds and <unknown> <unknown> . ''
and that 's a miracle . so , it 's a <unknown> . so he 's safe to empathize .
and he says , `` yes , '' he says ...
not like i 'm not like i -- -- i 'm <unknown> , i 'm a little bit , i 'm a little bit more <unknown> .
so he says that the power actually makes sense , because players can be able to achieve more than anything else in the real life , in the real life .
you can do it in a lot of social progress as much as we live in real real life , and they 're getting better feedback and reward in play as much as a real life .
so he says , it 's completely clear that there 's a lot of time that players are going to spend more time in the virtual world as well as the other time .
i just consider the thing that 's just after that , because it 's logical .
but it 's definitely no longer a <unknown> .
we have to start to try and find the real world in a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that 's less than a <unknown> years , and more than 2,500 years ago .
there are these <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> , you know ?
this fellow <unknown> <unknown> gave it <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
and these were the first thing that the first world was called the first evolved of people who have been <unknown> , and i 've been <unknown> the first <unknown> of the people .
and if you 're familiar with the work of the ancient greek <unknown> <unknown> , you may probably know the story . the story about how excited about how excited are done .
according to the <unknown> , we were working , more sophisticated , <unknown> <unknown> , in the kingdom , <unknown> in the 1970s , and a half years ago , when we invented a <unknown> while during the week , was a <unknown> .
but there 's a kind of significant fact that it 's been so many large organized that the king of the <unknown> was <unknown> to a crazy idea of a crazy idea of a crazy idea .
the great thing that were the great consequences . people fought .
it was a very intriguing situation . it was an extreme situation . you needed a very fundamental solution to it .
so they invented , according to the <unknown> , the <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> , a <unknown> strategy . in a day , you would eat food . the next day , you would play play .
and they would be so much in the <unknown> , and we 're playing so fascinating , and we 've been <unknown> with <unknown> , <unknown> productivity , they were expected to say that there was no longer there .
and then the next day you would play play . and the next day , and the next day , they would eat food .
and according to the <unknown> , they spent so 18 years to this long day , they were <unknown> out of the day and they were <unknown> out of a day and the next few .
so , as i think , i think , we 're going to play games today .
we 're playing games to make the <unknown> of the real world of the real world .
we 're playing games to say , which is not possible , in the real world , is not in the real life , and we 're going to make us we need
but it does n't have to be the end .
this is the exciting thing .
according to the <unknown> , after 18 years ago , he did n't have better than the weibo , so the author of the king , a <unknown> <unknown> , a final <unknown> <unknown> .
they shared the kingdom in two halves .
they were playing a <unknown> and the winner had to be <unknown> a <unknown> grip .
they were <unknown> <unknown> and they were looking at the building for a new way . they were just watching a lot of people , as he had food to survive and they could do with the rest of the area where they could
that sounds crazy , and what makes it sound , right ?
but the latest <unknown> show that the show that show you that the <unknown> , which is later the later room that the <unknown> room were actually <unknown> the same animal protein , the same dna <unknown> shows how old people are <unknown> .
so , scientists have been learned to explain that this obsession , that would be <unknown> that the <unknown> <unknown> sounds really wrong .
and the evidence of evidence that we found was a global <unknown> , which has been a <unknown> , and it was almost nearly 20 years , which almost nearly may be able to explain what the patient could explain .
so this crazy story sounds like this crazy man .
perhaps they have saved their people through play by taking the last few years in games , and then they had these <unknown> , and they 're often about the other things that they were doing
so , we can also do it .
we 're playing with <unknown> portraits in 1994 , and we 're walking in 1994 .
this was the first brain-controlled <unknown> in real world of the world of <unknown> , and it was 16 years ago .
they were 18 years of long and <unknown> years , we 're playing a year and we 've been playing a year and 16 years ago .
i claim we 're going to argue that we 're willing to make our own <unknown> game game .
so , they sent half the other of their civilization on the new way to a new world . so i can tell my 21 billion <unknown> per week .
we should think about it that the half of us took a hour every day with play until we have solved the problems of the real world .
i know you 're going to ask , `` how do we solve problems of the real world in games like a new world ? '' and that 's why i ask my question to work in the last years .
we 've got this robot in our office in palo alto in palo alto , and how we should understand what we should understand the future .
we do n't want to try to say to say the future before we should say to the future .
what we want to do is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best possible outcome , and then people start to <unknown> the idea that we can do to understand the idea of how we can do to understand the idea of reality .
we imagine the <unknown> , and we give people the opportunity to get them together to get them together .
i 'm going to show you some quick games that i designed to try to try to try to try to make people to be in the 2020s , and <unknown> in the future of future , and in the future of the future .
this is `` world without the world without oil . ''
the game is the 2007 .
it 's a <unknown> where you have to get a <unknown> of the <unknown> .
the <unknown> is , but we have enough <unknown> , so it 's going to be your life with no energy , and you get to the <unknown> , and you get to the <unknown> , which is where you 're going to be the world , and how do you 're in the
we tested this game with <unknown> players in 2007 . and we 've been doing it in the last three years .
and i can tell you that it was a change experience .
nobody wants to change the lives , because it 's good for the environment or is good for the environment or because we should be there .
but if you 're in a <unknown> conflict , and you 're going to get to the `` i 'm going to say , `` we 're going to be the oil . ''
this is a fascinating adventure thing to be here , you 're going to go to the fact that you 're going to be .
find out what you would survive . most of our teachers have been able to do the same <unknown> habits .
so we 've come to the next <unknown> game , we have a little bit of a bigger change , and the goal is a <unknown> , and we end up to the <unknown> , and <unknown> ,
we have the game of the <unknown> , which we developed , and <unknown> <unknown> at the center of the economy .
and the research is that we have a <unknown> of a <unknown> that we 've been used to do that the people who are only 23 years of the planet every year .
this <unknown> is called `` global <unknown> <unknown> , '' because of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course
the <unknown> of gamers , if you 're almost like a <unknown> , '' which is almost like a <unknown> <unknown> system .
you know , <unknown> <unknown> where there 's the <unknown> . and you have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unknown> , and the ones that are going to save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , we say , everybody is in the <unknown> , and it 's our way to make the future for energy , food , health , security , or the future of social justice .
30,000 players were playing the video of eight weeks ago .
they found 500 major creative solutions that you can read , if you 're <unknown> <unknown> , '' because <unknown> <unknown> .
and the last game is what we do is do about the march . september we 're doing a game in collaboration with the world bank , and it 's a game of cooperation , and i 'm not a computer games in the world bank .
if you compare the game , you 'll get the game , you get the internet with the world bank account for four years , in 2010 , <unknown> .
we 're working with the universities of the south africa in the africa , and we 're taking a social study to learn to develop social acumen .
we have a picture that we 've been called this , and we 've got `` <unknown> , '' and <unknown> to the <unknown> , <unknown> , sustainability , vision and <unknown> .
i want to share you all of the game with young people everywhere , over the world , from the most vulnerable , which is that they have contributed to learn to help their own social media for their own
i come to the end .
i want to ask you something like this .
what do you think is , what happens ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that we can do what we can do , but we have n't lost the real world .
well , i hope that i hope i think i 'd be able to remember that there are human skills that we can use to work in real life , and that games are creating a great meaning for change .
we 've got this whole , <unknown> effort , the productivity , to educate the social habits , <unknown> , and the craving for meaning meaning .
i really hope that we 're going to play with games games to survive another century .
and i hope you 're going to play a little bit like i 'm playing with me and play games .
now , when i take the next decade , i 'm sure to two things : that we can create every <unknown> future , and we can all have all kinds of games .
so i say i 'm going to say , let 's take the <unknown> games ! ''
thank you .
i 'd like to tell you something about what i 've been doing is something that i was doing a couple months ago , which was written by a paper for <unknown> , and i 've been writing a <unknown> for <unknown> 's <unknown> .
i 've always been doing my <unknown> <unknown> , but i was working with the work of the <unknown> , and i realized i 've never been in my life , which is the word `` <unknown> . ''
i read the one of the stage .
`` <unknown> , '' <unknown> , ♫ , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> ,
<unknown> : healthy , healthy , <unknown> , <unknown> , <unknown> . ''
i sent this list of a friend bruno , and i had to say , `` oh , i was so silly , but i was just going to be a <unknown> , and i was going to go to the <unknown> , and i was going to stop reading and see the <unknown> emotional shock .
of course , this was a <unknown> , <unknown> <unknown> . i just thought i thought that the copy must be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early '80s , when i started to work with the school , and i began to make my own outside of my <unknown> , and also to other other places , and then the other world to go around .
and god , i was n't using a <unknown> use of this before .
would i be able to do this one that i was born in a world that someone like me , to live a life of life , and i 'm going to be interested in the chances of the art and adventure that i 've been working on .
so i immediately sat down to the <unknown> of the <unknown> , and i was hoping to think of the <unknown> of 2009 and expect that i think that i think that i think that i think that i think that i think that 's a <unknown> for you .
here 's the <unknown> version of this <unknown> version of this video .
<unknown> is n't it much better .
in particular , i 've been doing the last two words ' `` <unknown> '' '' `` <unknown> '' and `` '' '' and `` '' '' and `` '' '' and `` '' '' and `` '' '' and `` '' '' and `` '' '' and `` '' '' and `` '' '' and `` '' '' and `` '' '' and `` '' '' and `` '' '' and `` '' '' and `` '' ''
but it 's not just about the words .
it 's about what we think about the people we describe what this is describe how to describe words , and that 's why i 'm listening to this words .
it 's about the values that are in the words , and how we put these values .
our language is essential to our thinking and how we 're going to see the world and the people around us .
many <unknown> societies , including the greek and the <unknown> , have really believed that the sounds of a <unknown> device has a big power , because what you can measure the <unknown> , it can <unknown> <unknown> .
so what do we want to do , `` what do we want to do -- <unknown> <unknown> , or a powerful people , or a powerful people ?
just one day , people are talking about as a child , but it 's a lot of the way to get to <unknown> them , and they are <unknown> and <unknown> ideas .
would n't be nice to get it to open the doors to open doors to the doors ?
a person who took me to my doors was my <unknown> of the <unknown> , and the one of the <unknown> <unknown> , <unknown> institute in <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> .
it 's called dr. <unknown> . a <unknown> , who 's thinking , most of the people , you can think , most americans do n't have to answer the right , and so he was called dr. <unknown> .
and dr. <unknown> just had a very common place , and was used for the work of work with the kids with the family , but it was very innovative way , how many images were like ,
i found the time i spent in my hospital , just got a great job , just -- great to -- i was just -- to my <unknown> .
i had to feel his exercises enough to often <unknown> these dynamics , <unknown> <unknown> -- in different colors -- that you can build up my <unknown> . and i have them flushed . i 've clocked them . i pulled them . i pulled them . i pulled them . i pulled them . i pulled them . i pulled them . i pulled them . i pulled them . i pulled them . i pulled them .
and imagine i 've had just been <unknown> , as i was just a kid child , dr. <unknown> and i tried to stop this practice trying to go to <unknown> , without a <unknown> .
and one day he saw me on a <unknown> -- this character 's just <unknown> and <unknown> -- and he said , `` wow , <unknown> , you 're so nice , <unknown> and young girls , you 're going to be one day of one of these
and if you can do it , i give you a hundred dollars . ''
and this was the very <unknown> trick of dr. v , so that i put the exercises i did n't want to do with the idea that people were going to be able to look at the rest of the world . but he was actually trying to figure out my new
and i 'm talking about how much of the vision of my life as a young and <unknown> young girl , i was able to help myself as a sort of nature of cheap , powerful and <unknown> human beings .
that 's just one example of many of how many of the adults can <unknown> choices contribute .
but as you 've been watching posters from the <unknown> , the idea that we do n't want to see a language , to understand what we would say , what we can tell us is to give them any of them to be able to see each other people to see themselves more powerful .
our language is <unknown> the social changes that are used in many cases that have been generated in a lot of society , and we have been evolving for a technological change .
from the <unknown> , you can say , my legs will <unknown> the <unknown> , <unknown> , and <unknown> <unknown> for the future , it 's going to allow all the opportunities to be able to develop , and to try to make a new way to help and communicate in the way that you can take a
so perhaps this evolution is <unknown> , because the thing is that there 's always a lot of truth , because that person 's human beings can actually be able to make a <unknown> , and that the human ability to make us
the human capacity is focused on -- that 's a interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me how to me , i 'm going to tell you something that my doctor has been to do for me , and i always feel like i ask
this sentence from storage with autism , and that 's , and , as a matter of how to make a challenge , to be able to do it as much as a life , i could be able to stay able to do a different from a <unknown> , and how people were
but the truth is that we 're changing . we 're going to be from the challenge , we 're whether it 's physically , whether it 's physically , soft , or even both of both .
and i argue that that 's the idea that is good .
<unknown> are not a obstacle that we have to have to be able to do to go to the work of something like a living better thing to get to do a better better , to come to the lives better yet .
cheap rights are just going to be just our way to our lives .
and i 'm hoping to make self-confidence , as though , to look , though , when i look fluent , to see my shadow , i think , i can follow my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he 's a <unknown> , he 's not going to see a little bit , but he 's always on me .
and i want to do the best part of the brain , and the <unknown> of the <unknown> of a <unknown> of a <unknown> , a <unknown> of the <unknown> .
there are all the life and challenges , and it 's just <unknown> , and every person is to make different , and the question is not , whether we 're not going to get a <unknown> , or not , but we 're going to get it all the
so we 're not just responsible for people who are love to keep <unknown> <unknown> , but they also slowly think of a little bit fun to get a little bit better .
and we do n't want to do our kids , if we give them the feeling that they can not afford to afford it not .
you have to collect two things out , to one way that the medical fact are <unknown> , and for other words , i think , is not a social idea about how i 'm a not
and to be honest , the only real and <unknown> disability that i had to do is to get apart , that the world always said , `` you can describe me with these kinds of things .
in our desire to protect the people that are us on the heart , and you know that the cool truth is to feel like a medical service , or you can think we need to think we 're going to say , we 're not going to give the
perhaps , in this case , the current concept that just does , what 's been in a <unknown> , and how we fix that , for a bigger disability than any week as the <unknown> .
if we do n't have a human , '' and not all the forces and opportunities and recognize it , we 're hoping to be the natural struggle that you might need to be a different disease .
we <unknown> a human being <unknown> that 's worth a society society .
so we have to have to look at the <unknown> of the front lines , and we have to focus on all of the future possibilities .
but the way , the most important thing is , it 's between the perception of our strengths and our incredible <unknown> , our amazing , we 're creating a connection .
we should n't have these <unknown> times , or what we should n't need to do is to try to avoid them , we should be able to keep you to the carpet , but it 's about how to solve the <unknown> , you know , in the
and i think that maybe it 's a way of thinking that we ca n't need to get to avoid threat , but that 's a bee to get them to the <unknown> , to take a <unknown> to the <unknown> , and then even to dance .
and we can do it , kiva , we see , to natural , to distinguish natural natural , complicated and useful , and feel out , and we do n't feel so much more than us , and that 's so much more than any other way .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 hour of charles darwin and talked about 12 years ago , darwin had talked about , in my eyes , in a very good in human character .
i would like it , i would n't have not the most effective of his own cells , and i ca n't even have the <unknown> of the <unknown> , but the fact that the changes of change in the future can be able to help .
and the arts are now creativity , creativity .
not only from the end of all , we know that the people of the people are to survive and survive , the fight of human beings is inherently connected to conflict .
so again , starting and manufacturing and <unknown> are the great skills of people that we have , the best abilities of people .
and maybe we just know how we 're going to be a <unknown> , if we 're going to be <unknown> , if we really become a nuclear attack , we 're going to be a <unknown> .
perhaps , that 's exactly the sense of integrity , a sense of the protein , a sense of the <unknown> , a sense of our own power , which is a sense of your own power .
we can give you a little bit better for us .
we can make empirical new choices that are about about heavy times more difficult times more likely to get over high times .
maybe we can measure biofuels to see how changing the change .
<unknown> are part of a change that we have n't adapted to have done .
i think the great risk that we have is to make ourselves ourselves , believe that we should be in our normal lives .
and the truth is , who 's normal ?
there 's no normal space .
it 's the usual . but the spectrum . but not the normal . and do you , and you 'll find those poor , really , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you 're really going to learn
i think , do n't think , do n't even do n't , as much , i do n't think , do n't think about it .
it would be great if we organize this paradigm of energy to another rule , or the strength to avoid it a little bit less dangerous , to help , and then we can use the forces of very many children , and then we can ask them to create their
<unknown> has found that that we 've got to be people from the development of our society , and we have to be able to make a <unknown> problem : useful useful and to have a sense of the way , and make a contribution .
there 's evidence that there are the <unknown> of the <unknown> of the people who 's been killed in the day of the people who are 19 years old people and people with local <unknown> <unknown> , and it was only because it 's been because the wisdom of the people of the people that we have a sense of the human life of society .
they do n't have these people like , but <unknown> , and they look at them ; they were being used as something that is special and valuable things .
a few years ago , i went to the city where i grew up in a <unknown> in the <unknown> red in the <unknown> red , and i was there
it was summer , and i had a <unknown> and i had <unknown> <unknown> .
and i hear how a guy behind me , `` i said , `` well , if this is not <unknown> <unknown> . ''
and i 'm looking at me , and i see this older man . i had no idea who i was .
and i love , `` sorry , sir , sir , what do we know ? i ca n't remember my life before you . ''
and he said , `` well , well , you still have to remember , i would n't remember , i 'm going to remember the way of me .
when i first saw it , i saw them , i was the <unknown> of the mother .
oh , so , the one thing .
but of course , it turns out , and of course , it turns out , and it 's done that it 's done , and then it turns out it 's incremental .
this was dr. <unknown> , a man i knew only about my mother 's talking about this day , because i 've been , very palpable , two weeks ago , i had a few weeks ago .
the doctor for <unknown> <unknown> mine was in los angeles , and i told my parents , the parents who had me who always had me to the people who were not in my world at all .
and because i was born without <unknown> , and my feet had to be asked by her , and i just just got a crazy toes at this time , and a few documents on the other little , he was a <unknown>
he said to me , `` i had to tell you the parents that you would never walk , and never work as if you know , like kids , or perhaps you never have a <unknown> life , and since you never remember life . ''
i really found that he was <unknown> that my <unknown> was attracted to me , and i was won , a <unknown> in the second , i was <unknown> with the <unknown> of the <unknown> , and he started these portraits of <unknown> <unknown> , and he <unknown> these portraits to <unknown> the <unknown>
and he called this part of his <unknown> <unknown> , the great factor , the potential of human being all about food .
you ca n't even enough how to use this part of the fact that this is possible for the most expensive one , which can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
and dr. <unknown> <unknown> , he said , `` i 've learned that kids , when you 're not going to get more other than it , and even if you 're just going to get a more supportive , you can help people , and then , children can help
see , dr. <unknown> , has <unknown> changed , think of his time .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and as someone who needed a company , two different things are so different kinds of things .
and i 've really changed my time to remember , when you were asked me to go to the age of 15 years , if i had my paints to the blood flow of bed and women , i would n't have a second <unknown> .
i was really afraid of what time is doing , but i was really afraid of what it 's like , again , i 've been doing it more well enough back at this time .
if you ask me to ask today , i 'm not really sure to be safe here for a certain way .
and that 's what it happens because i was able to do something with my legs , and i do n't even have to do this , and i do n't even know of this occasion .
and perhaps this change could happen to be because i think that 's a lot of people who are going to be able to move me to become more people who are trying to make me or to make a hint of
see , it takes really only a person who you show you how to you can find your forces , and they 're in the <unknown> , and they are in .
if you allow it to imagine it , your own , inner action , to make it in the brain , and the human spirit is so <unknown> -- if you open the door to a box , a car , a screen
they bring them to open them to open doors to their wings .
the real meaning of the word `` <unknown> '' in the word `` the <unknown> , '' in the word `` <unknown> '' .
it means that something that we 're doing is that in a way that is the potential to make the potential .
again , what the potential might better , because what are we going to do now ?
in the '60s , the u.k. was a <unknown> in a summer , and then , after this day , <unknown> had been <unknown> in <unknown> <unknown> , and they were <unknown> <unknown> in <unknown> .
they call this in `` <unknown> <unknown> '' in the u.s. , we call this `` the <unknown> '' a `` <unknown> '' . ''
students are going to come back to the <unknown> .
and the one of the students , they 're going to be <unknown> for more creative , and better robots , and better , so much better , etc .
they then have a <unknown> back of students with a special <unknown> , and they 've been told them , they were told they were very smart , and they have been able to write a lot of them .
and of course , it 's a way to hear a heart that the <unknown> was told the <unknown> , which is the reason for being <unknown> , she 's only enough .
and the same time , it was also the three months .
but just those who were still in school -- except by the students who had school students who had school school .
and the key thing that was that the most exciting thing is that the most of the study was that the teachers were not <unknown> , were the most <unknown> .
the teachers did n't know that something had changed that something changed the way .
and she was told you just the <unknown> and that is the students who have been the student with the date , and so they were going to help them and learn them and they were learning .
the only thing with the future is a <unknown> mind , and a <unknown> mind was a <unknown> , and there 's no hope more . he does n't find bad , and it does n't have our natural , very natural , and curiosity ,
but if we create it to help the human spirit to try to continue to try to find themselves , to others , to others , to be able to find beautiful and thinking about it , we 're going to be our systems really create a lot of
if a mind that these are the minds that are built these qualities , we can create a new reality and new <unknown> systems .
i want to end with a poem that was written by a <unknown> poet , and i told you my favorite books , not the god of the name , not the god of the <unknown> , but the god urges him
